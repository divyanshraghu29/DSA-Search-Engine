Leaving the Bartime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor a vector ?v=(x,y)v??=(x,y), define |v|=?x2+y2|v|=x2+y2???????.Allen had a bit too much to drink at the bar, which is at the origin. There are nn vectors ?v1,?v2,?,?vn. Allen will make n moves. As Allen's sense of direction is impaired, during the i-th move he will either move in the direction ?vi or ??vi. In other words, if his position is currently p=(x,y), he will either move to p+?vi or p??vi.Allen doesn't want to wander too far from home (which happens to also be the bar). You need to help him figure out a sequence of moves (a sequence of signs for the vectors) such that his final position p satisfies |p|?1.5?106 so that he can stay safe.InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1?n?105)?? the number of moves.Each of the following lines contains two space-separated integers xi and yi, meaning that ?vi=(xi,yi). We have that |vi|?106 for all i.OutputOutput a single line containing n integers c1,c2,?,cn, each of which is either 1 or ?1. Your solution is correct if the value of p=?ni=1ci?vi, satisfies |p|?1.5?106.It can be shown that a solution always exists under the given constraints.ExamplesInputCopy3999999 00 999999999999 0OutputCopy1 1 -1 InputCopy1-824590 246031OutputCopy1 InputCopy8-67761 603277640586 -39667146147 -122580569609 -2112400 914208131792 309779-850150 -4862935272 721899OutputCopy1 1 1 1 1 1 1 -1 "
