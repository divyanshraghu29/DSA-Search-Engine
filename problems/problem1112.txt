b"F. Dish Shoppingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are mm people living in a city. There are n dishes sold in the city. Each dish i has a price pi, a standard si and a beauty bi. Each person j has an income of incj and a preferred beauty prefj. A person would never buy a dish whose standard is less than the person's income. Also, a person can't afford a dish with a price greater than the income of the person. In other words, a person j can buy a dish i only if pi?incj?si.Also, a person j can buy a dish i, only if |bi?prefj|?(incj?pi). In other words, if the price of the dish is less than the person's income by k, the person will only allow the absolute difference of at most k between the beauty of the dish and his/her preferred beauty.
