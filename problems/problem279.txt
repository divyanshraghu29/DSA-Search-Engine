b'\nConsider an array AA with NN positive integers. \nLet B be defined as an array of N integers such that for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N:\n\nBi=Ai\xe2\x88\x921, if Ai is even.\nBi=Ai+1, if Ai is odd. \n\nYou are given an array C of size 2\xe2\x8b\x85N which is formed by taking all the elements of the arrays A and B and rearranging them.\nYou need to find the number of distinct arrays A whose sum of elements is K, from which C can be obtained.\nNote: Two arrays X and Y are considered to be distinct if there exists no rearrangement of X which is the same as Y.\nSince the final answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 109+7.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K - the parameters mentioned in the statement.\nThe second line of each test case contains 2\xe2\x8b\x85N space-separated integers C1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,C2N denoting the array C.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the number of distinct arrays A such that the sum of its elements is K. Print the answer modulo (109+7).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85106\nSum of N over all the test cases does not exceed 103.\n\nSubtasks\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 4\n1 2 3 4\n2 5\n1 2 3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: If A=[1,3], then B=[2,4]. C=[1,2,3,4] can be obtained by rearranging the elements of A and B. It can be proven that A=[1,3] is the only such distinct array whose elements sum to 4. Thus the answer is 1.\nNote that arrays [1,3] and [3,1] are not distinct.\nTest case 2: \n\nIf A=[2,3], then B=[1,4]. C=[1,2,3,4] can be obtained by rearranging the elements of A and B.\nIf A=[1,4], then B=[2,3]. C=[1,2,3,4] can be obtained by rearranging the elements of A and B.\n\nIt can be proven that [2,3] and [1,4] are the only such distinct arrays whose elements sum to 5. Thus the answer is 2.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85shreyshbapodia\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COUARR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy-medium, shreyshbapodia, start34\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2861\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
