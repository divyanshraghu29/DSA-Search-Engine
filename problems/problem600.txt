b'D. Nearest Excluded Pointstime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given nn distinct points on a plane. The coordinates of the ii-th point are (xi,yi)(xi,yi).For each point i, find the nearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) point with integer coordinates that is not among the given n points. If there are multiple such points ? you can choose any of them.The Manhattan distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is |x1?x2|+|y1?y2|.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer n (1?n?2?105) ? the number of points in the set.The next n lines describe points. The i-th of them contains two integers xi and yi (1?xi,yi?2?105) ? coordinates of the i-th point.It is guaranteed that all points in the input are distinct.OutputPrint n lines. In the i-th line, print the point with integer coordinates that is not among the given n points and is the nearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) to the i-th point from the input.Output coordinates should be in range [?106;106]. It can be shown that any optimal answer meets these constraints.If there are several answers, you can print any of them.ExamplesInputCopy6, 2 2, 1 2, 2 1, 3 2, 2 3, 5 5, OutputCopy1 1, 1 1, 2 0, 3 1, 2 4, 5 4, InputCopy8, 4 4, 2 4, 2 2, 2 3, 1 4, 4 2, 1 3, 3 3, OutputCopy4 3, 2 5, 2 1, 2 5, 1 5, 4 1, 1 2, 3 2, '
