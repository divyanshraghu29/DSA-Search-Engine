b"\nThere is an urgent need of NN agents for NN missions. The missions are numbered from 1 to N. All agents have some intelligence level denoted by their IQ (a positive integer ) . Major Francis asked Perry the platypus for the list of agents to be sent on missions. For each mission: i, there is  a default agent available (Ai) , and an Special agent (Bi) which may want some money(Ci)  to go on mission. Perry is busy with Candice, now you have to prepare the list of agents with the minimum amount to pay. Remember that Perry loves sorted things.  \nMore formally you have to make a non\xe2\x88\x92decreasing list of the agent's IQ by either selecting a default agent or paid agent , with minimum possible payment, Or determine that list cannot be made.  \nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase consists of 4 lines.\nFirst line of each testcase contains integer N denoting no. of missions.\nSecond line contains N space separated integers   (Ai)\ndescribing IQ level of default agent for the ith mission . \nThird line contains N space separated integers  (Bi)\ndescribing IQ level of special agent for the ith mission.  \nFourth line contains N space separated integers   (Ci)\ndescribing the cost  of  ith special agent.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, print in a single line the minimum cost that satisfys the given condition or \xe2\x88\x921  , if not possible.  \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa44000 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,Bi\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSample Input:\n3\n3\n1 4  2\n5 2 6\n4 5 6\n2\n5 2\n6 2\n7 2\n4\n4  2  2  5\n1  4  5  8\n10 2 3  16  \nSample Output:\n5\n -1\n5  \nEXPLANATION:\nIn first testcase  agents list possibles are:    [1 ,2 ,2] with 5 cost  and, [1 ,4, 6]  with 6 cost .\nIn second no sorted list of agents are possible :) \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85sherlock8696\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PERRY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, sherlock8696, str2020\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
