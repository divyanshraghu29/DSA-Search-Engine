b"A. Fancy Fencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEverybody knows that Bal?zs has the fanciest fence in the whole town. It's built up from NN fancy sections. The sections are rectangles standing closely next to each other on the ground. The ith section has integer height hi and integer width wi.  We are looking for fancy rectangles on this fancy fence.  A rectangle is fancy if:   its sides are either horizontal or vertical and have integer lengths  the distance between the rectangle and the ground is integer  the distance between the rectangle and the left side of the first section is integer  it's lying completely on sections  What is the number of fancy rectangles?  This number can be very big, so we are interested in it modulo 109+7.InputThe first line contains N (1?N?105) ? the number of sections.  The second line contains N space-separated integers, the ith number is hi (1?hi?109).  The third line contains N space-separated integers, the ith number is wi (1?wi?109).OutputYou should print a single integer, the number of fancy rectangles modulo 109+7. So the output range is 0,1,2,?,109+6.Scoring SubtaskPointsConstraints10sample212N?50andhi?50andwi=1for alli313hi=1orhi=2for alli415allhiare equal515hi?hi+1for alli?N?1618N?1000727no additional constraintsExampleInputCopy2, 1 2, 1 2, OutputCopy12, NoteThe fence looks like this:  There are 5 fancy rectangles of shape:  There are 3 fancy rectangles of shape:  There is 1 fancy rectangle of shape:  There are 2 fancy rectangles of shape:  There is 1 fancy rectangle of shape:  "
