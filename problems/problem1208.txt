For each query, you have to find any integer that occurs exactly once in the subarray of a from index li to index ri (a subarray is a contiguous subsegment of an array). For example, if a=[1,1,2,3,2,4], then for query (li=2,ri=6) the subarray we are interested in is [1,2,3,2,4], and possible answers are 1, 3 and 4; for query (li=1,ri=2) the subarray we are interested in is [1,1], and there is no such element that occurs exactly once.Can you answer all of the queries?InputThe first line contains one integer n (1?n?5?105).The second line contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (1?ai?5?105).The third line contains one integer q (1?q?5?105).Then q lines follow, i-th line containing two integers li and ri representing i-th query (1?li?ri?n).OutputAnswer the queries as follows:If there is no integer such that it occurs in the subarray from index li to index ri exactly once, print 0. Otherwise print any such integer.ExampleInputCopy61 1 2 3 2 422 61 2OutputCopy40'
