b"\n\xe2\x80\x9cJesse, you asked me if I was in the meth business, or the money business\xe2\x80\xa6 Neither. I\xe2\x80\x99m in the empire business.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWalter\xe2\x80\x99s sold his stack in Gray Matter Technologies, a company which he deserved half a credit, for peanuts. Now this company is worth a billion dollar company. Walter wants to get it's shares to have his Empire Business back and he founds an opportunity.  \nThere are $N$ persons having shares $A_1, A_2, A_3, \xe2\x80\xa6 A_N$ in this company. Walter can buy these shares with their minimum Sold Values. \nSold Values of a person's share $ i $ $(1 \\leq i \\leq N) $ with another person's share $ j $ $ (1 \\leq j \\leq N) $ is equal to $ A_j+|i-j| $. So, a person's share can have $ N $ possible sold values and Walter has to find minimum sold value among them for each person.\nSince Walter has to run his meth business also he asks you to find minimum sold value for each person.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the testcases follow. \nThe First line of each test case contains a integer $N$.\nThe Second line of each test case contains $N$ space integers namely $A_1,A_2,\xe2\x80\xa6A_N$.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in single line $N$ space integers denoting minimum sold value for each person.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n$1 \\leq N \\leq 2*10^6 $\n$1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9 $\n\nSum of $N$ over all test cases will not exceed $2*10^6$.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n    2\n    5\n    6 5 5 5 2\n    5\n    1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n    6 5 4 3 2\n    1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nExplanation\nFor first case:\n\nSold value for index $1$:  $6,6,7,8,6$\nSold value for index $2$:  $7,5,6,7,5$\nSold value for index $3$:  $8,6,5,6,4$\nSold value for index $4$:  $9,7,6,5,3$\nSold value for index $5$:  $10,8,7,6,2$\n\nMinimum sold value for each index will be $6,5,4,3,2$.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85aman1108\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SOLDVAL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aman1108, dynamic-programming, easy, infy20\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2042\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
