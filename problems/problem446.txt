You may modify it by performing the following operation zero or more times:\n\nLet K be the length of the LIS of the current sequence A.\nChoose a position in this sequence (possibly the beginning or end of the sequence) and insert a new element K into this sequence at this position.\nThis way, the sequence A changes and the next operation is performed on this changed sequence.\n\nFor example, if A = [3, 3, 4], then the LIS of A has length 2, so we can insert 2 anywhere into A, obtaining one of the sequences [2, 3, 3, \n 4], [3, 2, 3, 4], [3, 3, 2, 4] or [3, 3, 4, 2].\nFind the maximum length of the LIS of A that can be obtained after performing the given operation a finite number of times.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum possible length of the LIS.\nConstraints\n\n1 \\le T \\le 10^5\n1 \\le N \\le 10^6\n1 \\le A_i \\le 10^9 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10^6\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5\n5 4 3 2 1\n5\n5 4 3 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can perform the following operations (the newly inserted elements, which are always equal to the length of the LIS of the previous sequence, are underlined): [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] \\rightarrow [\\underline{1}, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] \\rightarrow [1, \\underline{2}, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] \\rightarrow [1, 2, \\underline{3}, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] \\rightarrow [1, 2, 3, \\underline{4}, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1].\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85sjshohag\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EXTREME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Dynamic Programming, Longest Increasing Subsequence, Observation, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms, DP on sequences, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3433\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-07-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
