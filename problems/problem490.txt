b'\nToday, Fluffy decided to play with a sequence of integers, $a_{1}$, $a_{2}$, $\\ldots$, $a_{n}$ which is coincidentally a permutation of the numbers $1$, $2$, $\\ldots$, $n$. Fluffy thinks that a sequence $b_{1}$, $b_{2}$, $\\ldots$, $b_{k}$ is alternating if and only if either of the following holds :\n\nFor all $i$, $b_{i} < b_{i + 1}$ if and only if $i$ is odd\nFor all $i$, $b_{i} < b_{i + 1}$ if and only if $i$ is even\n\nFor example, $1$,$4$,$2$,$5$,$3$ and $4$,$1$,$5$,$2$,$3$ are both alternating sequences.\nA subsequence of a sequence is a sequence that is formed by deleting zero or more elements of the original sequence. For example, $3$, $4$, $5$ is a subsequence of $1$, $3$, $2$, $4$, $7$, $6$, $5$. \nFlippy the bird has asked Fluffy to find the longest alternating subsequence of the array $a$, but there are so many of them, so he also wants to know the number of longest alternating subsequences. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$, the length of the sequence.\nThe next line contains $n$ space-separated integers, $a_{1}$, $a_{2}$, $\\ldots$, $a_{n}$. It is guaranteed that these numbers are a permutation of $1$, $2$, $\\ldots$, $n$.\n\nOutput\nOutput two space-separated integers, the length of the longest alternating subsequences and the number of longest alternating subsequences. Since there might be many longest alternating subsequences, output the number of alternating subsequences modulo $10^{9} + 7$\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (13 points) : $1 \\leq n \\leq 20$\nSubtask 2 (23 points) : $1 \\leq n \\leq 5000$\nSubtask 3 (64 points) : No additional constraints\nExample Input\n4\n2 1 3 4\n\nExample Output\n3 2\n\nExplanation\nThere are $2$ longest alternating subsequences, which have length $3$. They are $2$, $1$, $3$ and $2$, $1$, $4$.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85zscoder\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MCO16306\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, mco1602, segment-tree, segmentation, zscoder\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-11-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
