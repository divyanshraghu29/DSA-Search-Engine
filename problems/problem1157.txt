b"E. Vasya and a Treetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya has a tree consisting of nn vertices with root in vertex 11. At first all vertices has 00 written on it.Let d(i,j)d(i,j) be the distance between vertices ii and jj, i.e. number of edges in the shortest path from ii to jj. Also, let's denote kk-subtree of vertex xx ? set of vertices yy such that next two conditions are met:   xx is the ancestor of yy (each vertex is the ancestor of itself);  d(x,y)?kd(x,y)?k. Vasya needs you to process mm queries. The ii-th query is a triple vivi, didi and xixi. For each query Vasya adds value xixi to each vertex from didi-subtree of vivi.Report to Vasya all values, written on vertices of the tree after processing all queries.InputThe first line contains single integer nn (1?n?3?1051?n?3?105) ? number of vertices in the tree.Each of next n?1n?1 lines contains two integers xx and yy (1?x,y?n1?x,y?n) ? edge between vertices xx and yy. It is guarantied that given graph is a tree.Next line contains single integer mm (1?m?3?1051?m?3?105) ? number of queries.Each of next mm lines contains three integers vivi, didi, xixi (1?vi?n1?vi?n, 0?di?1090?di?109, 1?xi?1091?xi?109) ? description of the ii-th query.OutputPrint nn integers. The ii-th integers is the value, written in the ii-th vertex after processing all queries.ExamplesInputCopy5, 1 2, 1 3, 2 4, 2 5, 3, 1 1 1, 2 0 10, 4 10 100, OutputCopy1 11 1 100 0 , InputCopy5, 2 3, 2 1, 5 4, 3 4, 5, 2 0 4, 3 10 1, 1 2 3, 2 3 10, 1 1 7, OutputCopy10 24 14 11 11 , NoteIn the first exapmle initial values in vertices are 0,0,0,0,00,0,0,0,0. After the first query values will be equal to 1,1,1,0,01,1,1,0,0. After the second query values will be equal to 1,11,1,0,01,11,1,0,0. After the third query values will be equal to 1,11,1,100,01,11,1,100,0."
