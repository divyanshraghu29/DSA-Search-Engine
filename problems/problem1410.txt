b'D. Arpa?s letter-marked tree and Mehrdad?s Dokhtar-kosh pathstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputJust in case somebody missed it: we have wonderful girls in Arpa?s land.Arpa has a rooted tree (connected acyclic graph) consisting of n vertices. The vertices are numbered 1 through n, the vertex 1 is the root. There is a letter written on each edge of this tree. Mehrdad is a fan of Dokhtar-kosh things. He call a string Dokhtar-kosh, if we can shuffle the characters in string such that it becomes palindrome.  He asks Arpa, for each vertex v, what is the length of the longest simple path in subtree of v that form a Dokhtar-kosh string.InputThe first line contains integer n (1?????n?????5?105)?? the number of vertices in the tree.(n??-??1) lines follow, the i-th of them contain an integer pi?+?1 and a letter ci?+?1 (1?????pi?+?1?????i, ci?+?1 is lowercase English letter, between a and v, inclusively), that mean that there is an edge between nodes pi?+?1 and i?+?1 and there is a letter ci?+?1 written on this edge.OutputPrint n integers. The i-th of them should be the length of the longest simple path in subtree of the i-th vertex that form a Dokhtar-kosh string.ExamplesInputCopy41 s2 a3 sOutputCopy3 1 1 0 InputCopy51 a2 h1 a4 hOutputCopy4 1 0 1 0 '
