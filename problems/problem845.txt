b"B. Identify the Operationstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWe start with a permutation a1,a2,?,an and with an empty array b. We apply the following operation k times.On the i-th iteration, we select an index ti (1?ti?n?i+1), remove ati from the array, and append one of the numbers ati?1 or ati+1 (if ti?1 or ti+1 are within the array bounds) to the right end of the array b. Then we move elements ati+1,?,an to the left in order to fill in the empty space.You are given the initial permutation a1,a2,?,an and the resulting array b1,b2,?,bk. All elements of an array b are distinct. Calculate the number of possible sequences of indices t1,t2,?,tk modulo 998244353.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1?t?100000), denoting the number of test cases, followed by a description of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers n,k (1?k<n?200000): sizes of arrays a and b.The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (1?ai?n): elements of a. All elements of a are distinct.The third line of each test case contains k integers b1,b2,?,bk (1?bi?n): elements of b. All elements of b are distinct.The sum of all n among all test cases is guaranteed to not exceed 200000.OutputFor each test case print one integer: the number of possible sequences modulo 998244353.ExampleInputCopy3, 5 3, 1 2 3 4 5, 3 2 5, 4 3, 4 3 2 1, 4 3 1, 7 4, 1 4 7 3 6 2 5, 3 2 4 5, OutputCopy2, 0, 4, NoteLet's denote as a1a2?aiai+1_?an?a1a2?ai?1ai+1?an?1 an operation over an element with index i: removal of element ai from array a and appending element ai+1 to array b.In the first example test, the following two options can be used to produce the given array b:  123_45?12_35?125_?12; (t1,t2,t3)=(4,3,2);  123_45?12_35?235_?15; (t1,t2,t3)=(4,1,2). In the second example test, it is impossible to achieve the given array no matter the operations used. That's because, on the first application, we removed the element next to 4, namely number 3, which means that it couldn't be added to array b on the second step.In the third example test, there are four options to achieve the given array b:  1473_625?14362_5?14_325?4325_?435; 1473_625?14362_5?14_325?1425_?145; 1473_625?14732_5?14_725?4725_?475; 1473_625?14732_5?14_725?1425_?145;"
