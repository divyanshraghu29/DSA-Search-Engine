You are given the pseudocode of his solution, where the function getAnswer calculates the answer to the problem:getAnswer(a[1..n], b[1..len], h)  answer = 0  for i = 1 to n-len+1    answer = answer + f(a[i..i+len-1], b, h, 1)  return answerf(s[1..len], b[1..len], h, index)  if index = len+1 then    return 1  for i = 1 to len    if s[index] + b[i] >= h      mem = b[i]      b[i] = 0      res = f(s, b, h, index + 1)      b[i] = mem      if res > 0        return 1  return 0Your task is to help Manao optimize his algorithm.InputThe first line contains space-separated integers n, len and h (1???len???n???150000;?1???h???109). The second line contains len space-separated integers b1,?b2,?...,?blen (1???bi???109). The third line contains n space-separated integers a1,?a2,?...,?an (1???ai???109).OutputPrint a single number ? the answer to Manao's problem.ExamplesInputCopy5 2 105 31 8 5 5 7OutputCopy2"
