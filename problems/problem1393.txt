We will say that two radio stations with numbers i and j reach each other, if the broadcasting range of each of them is more or equal to the distance between them. In other words min(ri,?rj)???|xi?-?xj|.Let's call a pair of radio stations (i,?j) bad if i?<?j, stations i and j reach each other and they are close in frequency, that is, |fi?-?fj|???k.Find the number of bad pairs of radio stations.InputThe first line contains two integers n and k (1???n???105, 0???k???10) ? the number of radio stations and the maximum difference in the frequencies for the pair of stations that reach each other to be considered bad.In the next n lines follow the descriptions of radio stations. Each line contains three integers xi, ri and fi (1???xi,?ri???109, 1???fi???104) ? the coordinate of the i-th radio station, it's broadcasting range and it's broadcasting frequency. No two radio stations will share a coordinate.OutputOutput the number of bad pairs of radio stations.ExamplesInputCopy3 21 3 103 2 54 10 8OutputCopy1InputCopy3 31 3 103 2 54 10 8OutputCopy2InputCopy5 11 3 22 2 43 2 14 2 15 3 3OutputCopy2InputCopy5 11 5 22 5 43 5 14 5 15 5 3OutputCopy5"
