The number 1 is coprime to all the positive integers and ?(1)?=?1.Now the teacher gave Vovochka an array of n positive integers a1,?a2,?...,?an and a task to process q queries li ri?? to calculate and print  modulo 109?+?7. As it is too hard for a second grade school student, you've decided to help Vovochka.InputThe first line of the input contains number n (1???n???200?000)?? the length of the array given to Vovochka. The second line contains n integers a1,?a2,?...,?an (1???ai???106).The third line contains integer q (1???q???200?000)?? the number of queries. Next q lines contain the queries, one per line. Each query is defined by the boundaries of the segment li and ri (1???li???ri???n).OutputPrint q numbers ? the value of the Euler function for each query, calculated modulo 109?+?7.ExamplesInputCopy101 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1071 13 85 64 88 107 97 10OutputCopy14608815361921441152InputCopy724 63 13 52 6 10 163 54 71 72 43 62 6OutputCopy124876812939264112329984539136NoteIn the second sample the values are calculated like that:  ?(13?52?6)?=??(4056)?=?1248  ?(52?6?10?1)?=??(3120)?=?768  ?(24?63?13?52?6?10?1)?=??(61326720)?=?12939264  ?(63?13?52)?=??(42588)?=?11232  ?(13?52?6?10)?=??(40560)?=?9984  ?(63?13?52?6?10)?=??(2555280)?=?539136 "
