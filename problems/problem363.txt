b"\nAmal decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly $n$ days. She knows that on the $i$-th day $(1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89i\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n)$ she makes $a_i$ money. Amal loves progress, that's why she wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence $a_i$. Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.\nHelp Amal cope with this task!\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single positive integer $n$ $(1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910^5)$, number of days.\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89a_2,\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89a_n$ $(1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a_i\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910^9)$.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence $a$.\nSample Inputs\n6\n2 2 1 3 4 1\n\n3\n2 2 9\n\nSample Outputs\n3\n\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the third to the fifth one.\nIn the second test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the first to the third one.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsqu_test\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HW2E\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 chw22020, counting-sort, dynamic-programming, squ_test\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-04-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
