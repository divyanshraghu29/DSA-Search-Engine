b"D. Traffic Jams in the Landtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSome country consists of (n?+?1) cities, located along a straight highway. Let's number the cities with consecutive integers from 1 to n?+?1 in the order they occur along the highway. Thus, the cities are connected by n segments of the highway, the i-th segment connects cities number i and i?+?1. Every segment of the highway is associated with a positive integer ai?>?1 ? the period of traffic jams appearance on it. In order to get from city x to city y (x?<?y), some drivers use the following tactics. Initially the driver is in city x and the current time t equals zero. Until the driver arrives in city y, he perfors the following actions:  if the current time t is a multiple of ax, then the segment of the highway number x is now having traffic problems and the driver stays in the current city for one unit of time (formally speaking, we assign t?=?t?+?1);  if the current time t is not a multiple of ax, then the segment of the highway number x is now clear and that's why the driver uses one unit of time to move to city x?+?1 (formally, we assign t?=?t?+?1 and x?=?x?+?1). You are developing a new traffic control system. You want to consecutively process q queries of two types:  determine the final value of time t after the ride from city x to city y (x?<?y) assuming that we apply the tactics that is described above. Note that for each query t is being reset to 0.  replace the period of traffic jams appearing on the segment number x by value y (formally, assign ax?=?y). Write a code that will effectively process the queries given above.InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1???n???105) ? the number of highway segments that connect the n?+?1 cities.The second line contains n integers a1,?a2,?...,?an (2???ai???6) ? the periods of traffic jams appearance on segments of the highway.The next line contains a single integer q (1???q???105) ? the number of queries to process.The next q lines contain the descriptions of the queries in the format c, x, y (c ? the query type). If c is character 'A', then your task is to process a query of the first type. In this case the following constraints are satisfied: 1???x?<?y???n?+?1.If c is character 'C', then you need to process a query of the second type. In such case, the following constraints are satisfied: 1???x???n, 2???y???6.OutputFor each query of the first type output a single integer ? the final value of time t after driving from city x to city y. Process the queries in the order in which they are given in the input.ExamplesInputCopy102 5 3 2 3 5 3 4 2 410C 10 6A 2 6A 1 3C 3 4A 3 11A 4 9A 5 6C 7 3A 8 10A 2 5OutputCopy53146244"
