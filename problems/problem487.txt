b"\nGeralt is an expert alchemist but always finds it difficult to find the right herbs. So he started his own farm of herbs, where he would grow his own herbs. Right now, he has $N$ different herbs in a row on his farm. He was getting bored, so he came up with a challenging problem for you:\nYou are allowed to divide the $N$ herbs into non-empty groups by creating some partitions (possibly zero) between the herbs such that each group contains at most $M$ herbs. Your task is to find the number of distinct groupings. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo $10^9+7$.\nNote: Two groupings are considered distinct if\n\nBoth contain a different number of groups, else if\nThe $i^{th}$ groups (from the left) for both groupings contain different numbers of herbs.\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then $T$ test cases follow. \nEach test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in a single line the required answer modulo $10^9+7$.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n$1 \\leq N \\leq 2000$\n$1 \\leq M \\leq N$\n\nSample Input:\n4\n1 1\n3 2\n2 1\n8 3  \nSample Output:\n1\n3\n1\n81  \nExplanation:\nFor the $2^{nd}$ test case, the different groupings are: $(1,1,1), (1,2)$ and $(2,1)$. Here, the numbers in the braces represent the number of herbs in each group for the respective grouping. There's only one possible grouping for test case $1$ and $3$, i.e., group each herb individually.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85sibasish_14\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/QLK02\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy-medium, sibasish_14, sibasish_14, yapc2020\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
