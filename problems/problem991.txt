There are nn pipes with coordinates xixi that are connected to LCC. When the experiment starts at time 0, ii-th proton flies from the i-th pipe with speed vi. It flies to the right with probability pi and flies to the left with probability (1?pi). The duration of the experiment is determined as the time of the first collision of any two protons. In case there is no collision, the duration of the experiment is considered to be zero.Find the expected value of the duration of the experiment.Illustration for the first exampleInputThe first line of input contains one integer n?? the number of pipes (1?n?105). Each of the following n lines contains three integers xi, vi, pi?? the coordinate of the i-th pipe, the speed of the i-th proton and the probability that the i-th proton flies to the right in percentage points (?109?xi?109,1?v?106,0?pi?100). It is guaranteed that all xi are distinct and sorted in increasing order.OutputIt's possible to prove that the answer can always be represented as a fraction P/Q, where P is an integer and Q is a natural number not divisible by 998244353. In this case, print P?Q?1 modulo 998244353.ExamplesInputCopy2, 1 1 100, 3 1 0, OutputCopy1, InputCopy3, 7 10 0, 9 4 86, 14 5 100, OutputCopy0, InputCopy4, 6 4 50, 11 25 50, 13 16 50, 15 8 50, OutputCopy150902884, "
