b"B. Petr#time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLong ago, when Petya was a schoolboy, he was very much interested in the Petr# language grammar. During one lesson Petya got interested in the following question: how many different continuous substrings starting with the sbegin and ending with the send (it is possible sbegin?=?send), the given string t has. Substrings are different if and only if their contents aren't equal, their positions of occurence don't matter. Petya wasn't quite good at math, that's why he couldn't count this number. Help him!InputThe input file consists of three lines. The first line contains string t. The second and the third lines contain the sbegin and send identificators, correspondingly. All three lines are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of each string doesn't exceed 2000 characters.OutputOutput the only number ? the amount of different substrings of t that start with sbegin and end with send.ExamplesInputCopyroundroouOutputCopy1InputCopycodeforcescodeforcaOutputCopy0InputCopyabababababOutputCopy4InputCopyabaabbaOutputCopy1NoteIn the third sample there are four appropriate different substrings. They are: ab, abab, ababab, abababab.In the fourth sample identificators intersect."
