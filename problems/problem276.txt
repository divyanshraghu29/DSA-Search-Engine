b'\nYou are given an array A=[A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN] containing N elements. You are also given Q ordered pairs of integers, where the i-th pair is denoted (x_i, y_i).\nA subsequence of A, say [A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, \\ldots, A_{i_k}], is said to be magical if the following condition is satisfied:\n\nFor each 1 \\leq j \\lt k, (A_{i_j}, A_{i_{j+1}}) must be among the given Q pairs. That is, each consecutive pair of elements in this subsequence must be among the given Q pairs.\n\nFind the length of the longest magical subsequence of A, and print the indices of one such longest subsequence. \nIf there are multiple longest magical subsequences, you may print the indices of any of them.\nNote: Array contains at least one valid subsequence of length greater than or equal to 2.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N, denoting the length of the array.\nThe second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.\nThe third line of each test case contains an integer Q, denoting the number of pairs.\nThe i-th of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers x_i and y_i \xe2\x80\x94 the i-th ordered pair.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print two lines.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer K \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the longest magical subsequence of A. \nThe second line should contain K space-separated integers in ascending order, denoting the indices of the magical subsequence you found.\n\nIn case there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nConstraints\n\n1 \\leq T \\leq 50\n1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^6\n1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5\n1 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^6\nThe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5.\nThe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n7\n1 3 2 8 3 7 6\n5\n3 7\n3 3\n3 8\n8 7\n8 6\n5\n1 2 1 2 1\n5\n2 1\n3 1\n1 1\n3 2\n1 2\n4\n1 2 1 4\n5\n1 3\n1 1\n1 4\n2 4\n4 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 4 7 \n5\n1 2 3 4 5 \n3\n1 3 4 \n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1:  The length of the longest magical subsequence is 3. One such subsequence is [3, 8, 6], given by indices [2, 4, 7]. The adjacent pairs are (3, 8) and (8, 6), both of which are among the given pairs.\nTest case 2: The length of the longest magical subsequence is 5 \xe2\x80\x94 take the entire array. Adjacent elements are (1, 2) and (2, 1), both of which are in the given pairs.\nTest case 3: The length of the longest magical subsequence is 3. One such subsequence of length 3 is [1, 1, 4], with indices [1, 3, 4]. Adjacent elements are (1, 1) and (1, 4), which are among the given pairs.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85mystic_ankush\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85tejas10p\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MSUB121\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Subsequence\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms, Groupings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3072\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
