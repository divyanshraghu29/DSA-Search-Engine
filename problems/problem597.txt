Arithmetic Operationstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array of integers a1,a2,?,ana1,a2,?,an.You can do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):   Choose any index ii and set aiai to any integer (positive, negative or 0). What is the minimum number of operations needed to turn a into an arithmetic progression? The array a is an arithmetic progression if ai+1?ai=ai?ai?1 for any 2?i?n?1.InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1?n?105).The second line contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (1?ai?105).OutputPrint a single integer: the minimum number of operations needed to turn a into an arithmetic progression.ExamplesInputCopy9, 3 2 7 8 6 9 5 4 1, OutputCopy6, InputCopy14, 19 2 15 8 9 14 17 13 4 14 4 11 15 7, OutputCopy10, InputCopy10, 100000 1 60000 2 20000 4 8 16 32 64, OutputCopy7, InputCopy4, 10000 20000 10000 1, OutputCopy2, NoteIn the first test, you can get the array a=[11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3] by performing 6 operations:   Set a3 to 9: the array becomes [3,2,9,8,6,9,5,4,1];  Set a2 to 10: the array becomes [3,10,9,8,6,9,5,4,1];  Set a6 to 6: the array becomes [3,10,9,8,6,6,5,4,1];  Set a9 to 3: the array becomes [3,10,9,8,6,6,5,4,3];  Set a5 to 7: the array becomes [3,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3];  Set a1 to 11: the array becomes [11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3]. a is an arithmetic progression: in fact, ai+1?ai=ai?ai?1=?1 for any 2?i?n?1.There is no sequence of less than 6 operations that makes a an arithmetic progression.In the second test, you can get the array a=[?1,2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38] by performing 10 operations.In the third test, you can get the array a=[100000,80000,60000,40000,20000,0,?20000,?40000,?60000,?80000] by performing 7 operations.'
