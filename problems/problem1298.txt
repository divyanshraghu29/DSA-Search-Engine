Let's build a graph on vertices 1,?2,?...,?n in such a way that there is an edge between vertices u and v if and only if . Let d(u,?v) be the shortest distance between u and v, or 0 if there is no path between them. Compute the sum of values d(u,?v) over all 1???u?<?v???n.The gcd (greatest common divisor) of two positive integers is the maximum positive integer that divides both of the integers.InputSingle integer n (1???n???107).OutputPrint the sum of d(u,?v) over all 1???u?<?v???n.ExamplesInputCopy6OutputCopy8InputCopy10OutputCopy44NoteAll shortest paths in the first example:              There are no paths between other pairs of vertices.The total distance is 2?+?1?+?1?+?2?+?1?+?1?=?8."
