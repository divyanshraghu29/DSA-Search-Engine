b'D1. Optimal Subsequences (Easy Version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easier version of the problem. In this version 1?n,m?1001?n,m?100. You can hack this problem only if you solve and lock both problems.You are given a sequence of integers a=[a1,a2,?,an]a=[a1,a2,?,an] of length nn. Its subsequence is obtained by removing zero or more elements from the sequence a (they do not necessarily go consecutively). For example, for the sequence a=[11,20,11,33,11,20,11]:  [11,20,11,33,11,20,11], [11,20,11,33,11,20], [11,11,11,11], [20], [33,20] are subsequences (these are just some of the long list);  [40], [33,33], [33,20,20], [20,20,11,11] are not subsequences. Suppose that an additional non-negative integer k (1?k?n) is given, then the subsequence is called optimal if:  it has a length of k and the sum of its elements is the maximum possible among all subsequences of length k;  and among all subsequences of length k that satisfy the previous item, it is lexicographically minimal. Recall that the sequence b=[b1,b2,?,bk] is lexicographically smaller than the sequence c=[c1,c2,?,ck] if the first element (from the left) in which they differ less in the sequence b than in c. Formally: there exists t (1?t?k) such that b1=c1, b2=c2, ..., bt?1=ct?1 and at the same time bt<ct. For example:  [10,20,20] lexicographically less than [10,21,1],  [7,99,99] is lexicographically less than [10,21,1],  [10,21,0] is lexicographically less than [10,21,1]. You are given a sequence of a=[a1,a2,?,an] and m requests, each consisting of two numbers kj and posj (1?k?n, 1?posj?kj). For each query, print the value that is in the index posj of the optimal subsequence of the given sequence a for k=kj.For example, if n=4, a=[10,20,30,20], kj=2, then the optimal subsequence is [20,30] ? it is the minimum lexicographically among all subsequences of length 2 with the maximum total sum of items. Thus, the answer to the request kj=2, posj=1 is the number 20, and the answer to the request kj=2, posj=2 is the number 30.InputThe first line contains an integer n (1?n?100) ? the length of the sequence a.The second line contains elements of the sequence a: integer numbers a1,a2,?,an (1?ai?109).The third line contains an integer m (1?m?100) ? the number of requests.The following m lines contain pairs of integers kj and posj (1?k?n, 1?posj?kj) ? the requests.OutputPrint m integers r1,r2,?,rm (1?rj?109) one per line: answers to the requests in the order they appear in the input. The value of rj should be equal to the value contained in the position posj of the optimal subsequence for k=kj.ExamplesInputCopy3, 10 20 10, 6, 1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 3 1, 3 2, 3 3, OutputCopy20, 10, 20, 10, 20, 10, InputCopy7, 1 2 1 3 1 2 1, 9, 2 1, 2 2, 3 1, 3 2, 3 3, 1 1, 7 1, 7 7, 7 4, OutputCopy2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, NoteIn the first example, for a=[10,20,10] the optimal subsequences are:   for k=1: [20],  for k=2: [10,20],  for k=3: [10,20,10].
