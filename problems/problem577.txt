b"H2. Maximum Crossings (Hard Version)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe only difference between the two versions is that in this version n?2?105n?2?105 and the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2?1052?105.A terminal is a row of nn equal segments numbered 1 to n in order. There are two terminals, one above the other. You are given an array a of length n. For all i=1,2,?,n, there should be a straight wire from some point on segment i of the top terminal to some point on segment ai of the bottom terminal. You can't select the endpoints of a segment. For example, the following pictures show two possible wirings if n=7 and a=[4,1,4,6,7,7,5].  A crossing occurs when two wires share a point in common. In the picture above, crossings are circled in red.What is the maximum number of crossings there can be if you place the wires optimally?InputThe first line contains an integer t (1?t?1000)?? the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1?n?2?105)?? the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (1?ai?n)?? the elements of the array.The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2?105.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer?? the maximum number of crossings there can be if you place the wires optimally.ExampleInputCopy4, 7, 4 1 4 6 7 7 5, 2, 2 1, 1, 1, 3, 2 2 2, OutputCopy6, 1, 0, 3, NoteThe first test case is shown in the second picture in the statement.In the second test case, the only wiring possible has the two wires cross, so the answer is 1.In the third test case, the only wiring possible has one wire, so the answer is 0."
