You need to process Q queries. In each query, you will be given three integers l, r and k. You need to print the number of integers x between l and r inclusive, such that g(x)?=?k. InputThe first line of the input contains an integer Q (1???Q???2???105) representing the number of queries. Q lines follow, each of which contains 3 integers l, r and k (1???l???r???106,?1???k???9).OutputFor each query, print a single line containing the answer for that query.ExamplesInputCopy422 73 945 64 647 55 72 62 4OutputCopy1408InputCopy482 94 656 67 428 59 939 74 4OutputCopy3115NoteIn the first example:  g(33)?=?9 as g(33)?=?g(3???3)?=?g(9)?=?9  g(47)?=?g(48)?=?g(60)?=?g(61)?=?6  There are no such integers between 47 and 55.  g(4)?=?g(14)?=?g(22)?=?g(27)?=?g(39)?=?g(40)?=?g(41)?=?g(58)?=?4 '
