b'D. You Are Given a Treetime limit per test7 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA tree is an undirected graph with exactly one simple path between each pair of vertices. We call a set of simple paths kk-valid if each vertex of the tree belongs to no more than one of these paths (including endpoints) and each path consists of exactly kk vertices.You are given a tree with nn vertices. For each kk from 1 to n inclusive find what is the maximum possible size of a k-valid set of simple paths.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2?n?100000)?? the number of vertices in the tree.Then following n?1 lines describe the tree, each of them contains two integers v, u (1?v,u?n)?? endpoints of the corresponding edge.It is guaranteed, that the given graph is a tree. OutputOutput n numbers, the i-th of which is the maximum possible number of paths in an i-valid set of paths.ExamplesInputCopy71 22 33 44 55 66 7OutputCopy7321111InputCopy61 22 32 41 55 6OutputCopy622110NoteOne way to achieve the optimal number of paths for the second sample is illustrated in the following picture:'
