The station in the ii-th city has height hihi and range wiwi. It can broadcast information to city jj if the following constraints are met:   i?j?wii?j?wi, and  for each kk such that i<k?ji<k?j, the following condition holds: hk<hihk<hi.  In other words, the station in city ii can broadcast information to city jj if j?ij?i, jj is in the range of ii-th station, and ii is strictly highest on the range from ii to jj (including city jj).At the beginning, for every city ii, hi=0hi=0 and wi=iwi=i.Then qq events will take place. During ii-th event one of the following will happen:   City cici will rebuild its station so that its height will be strictly highest among all stations and wciwci will be set to gigi.  Let bjbj be the number of stations that can broadcast information to city jj. Print the sum of bjbj over all jj satisfying li?j?rili?j?ri. Your task is to react to all events and print answers to all queries.InputThe first line contains two integers nn and qq (1?n,q?2?1051?n,q?2?105) ? number of cities and number of events.Then qq lines follow. The ii-th line begins with an integer pipi (pi=1pi=1 or pi=2pi=2).If pi=1pi=1 a station will be rebuilt. Then two integers cici and gigi (1?ci?gi?n1?ci?gi?n) follow ? the city in which the station is rebuilt and its new broadcasting range.If pi=2pi=2 you are given a query. Then two integers lili and riri (1?li?ri?n1?li?ri?n) follow ? the range of cities in the query.OutputFor each query, print in a single line the sum of bjbj over the given interval.ExamplesInputCopy1 3, 2 1 1, 1 1 1, 2 1 1, OutputCopy1, 1, InputCopy5 10, 1 3 4, 2 3 5, 1 1 5, 2 1 5, 1 4 5, 2 2 4, 1 2 3, 2 1 3, 1 5 5, 2 2 5, OutputCopy4, 10, 5, 4, 5, NoteIn the first test case, only station 11 reaches city 11 before and after it is rebuilt.In the second test case, after each rebuild, the array bb looks as follows:   [1,1,1,2,1][1,1,1,2,1];  [1,2,2,3,2][1,2,2,3,2];  [1,2,2,1,2][1,2,2,1,2];  [1,1,2,1,2][1,1,2,1,2];  [1,1,2,1,1][1,1,2,1,1].
