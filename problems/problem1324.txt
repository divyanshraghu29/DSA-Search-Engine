The nodes are labeled from 1 to n, while the edges are labeled from 1 to 2n?-?2. The graph's edges can be split into two parts.  The first n?-?1 edges will form a rooted spanning tree, with node 1 as the root. All these edges will point away from the root.  The last n?-?1 edges will be from node i to node 1, for all 2???i???n. You are given q queries. There are two types of queries  1 i w: Change the weight of the i-th edge to w  2 u v: Print the length of the shortest path between nodes u to v Given these queries, print the shortest path lengths.InputThe first line of input will contain two integers n,?q (2???n,?q???200?000), the number of nodes, and the number of queries, respectively.The next 2n?-?2 integers will contain 3 integers ai,?bi,?ci, denoting a directed edge from node ai to node bi with weight ci.The first n?-?1 of these lines will describe a rooted spanning tree pointing away from node 1, while the last n?-?1 of these lines will have bi?=?1.More specifically,   The edges (a1,?b1),?(a2,?b2),?... (an?-?1,?bn?-?1) will describe a rooted spanning tree pointing away from node 1.  bj?=?1 for n???j???2n?-?2.  an,?an?+?1,?...,?a2n?-?2 will be distinct and between 2 and n. The next q lines will contain 3 integers, describing a query in the format described in the statement.All edge weights will be between 1 and 106.OutputFor each type 2 query, print the length of the shortest path in its own line.ExampleInputCopy5 91 3 13 2 21 4 33 5 45 1 53 1 62 1 74 1 82 1 12 1 32 3 52 5 21 1 1002 1 31 8 302 4 22 2 4OutputCopy014810013210"
