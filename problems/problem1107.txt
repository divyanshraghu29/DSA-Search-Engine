Lynyrd and Skynyrd became bored, so they asked you q queries, each of which has the following form: "does the subsegment of a from the l-th to the r-th positions, inclusive, have a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of p?" Please answer the queries.A permutation of length n is a sequence of n integers such that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in it.A cyclic shift of a permutation (p1,p2,?,pn) is a permutation (pi,pi+1,?,pn,p1,p2,?,pi?1) for some i from 1 to n. For example, a permutation (2,1,3) has three distinct cyclic shifts: (2,1,3), (1,3,2), (3,2,1).A subsequence of a subsegment of array a from the l-th to the r-th positions, inclusive, is a sequence ai1,ai2,?,aik for some i1,i2,?,ik such that l?i1<i2<?<ik?r.InputThe first line contains three integers n, m, q (1?n,m,q?2?105)?? the length of the permutation p, the length of the array a and the number of queries.The next line contains n integers from 1 to n, where the i-th of them is the i-th element of the permutation. Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once.The next line contains m integers from 1 to n, the i-th of them is the i-th element of the array a.The next q lines describe queries. The i-th of these lines contains two integers li and ri (1?li?ri?m), meaning that the i-th query is about the subsegment of the array from the li-th to the ri-th positions, inclusive.OutputPrint a single string of length q, consisting of 0 and 1, the digit on the i-th positions should be 1, if the subsegment of array a from the li-th to the ri-th positions, inclusive, contains a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of p, and 0 otherwise.ExamplesInputCopy3 6 32 1 31 2 3 1 2 31 52 63 5OutputCopy110InputCopy2 4 32 11 1 2 21 22 33 4OutputCopy010NoteIn the first example the segment from the 1-st to the 5-th positions is 1,2,3,1,2. There is a subsequence 1,3,2 that is a cyclic shift of the permutation. The subsegment from the 2-nd to the 6-th positions also contains a subsequence 2,1,3 that is equal to the permutation. The subsegment from the 3-rd to the 5-th positions is 3,1,2, there is only one subsequence of length 3 (3,1,2), but it is not a cyclic shift of the permutation.In the second example the possible cyclic shifts are 1,2 and 2,1. The subsegment from the 1-st to the 2-nd positions is 1,1, its subsequences are not cyclic shifts of the permutation. The subsegment from the 2-nd to the 3-rd positions is 1,2, it coincides with the permutation. The subsegment from the 3 to the 4 positions is 2,2, its subsequences are not cyclic shifts of the permutation.'
