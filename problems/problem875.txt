b"A. k-Amazing Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array aa consisting of n integers numbered from 1 to n.Let's define the k-amazing number of the array as the minimum number that occurs in all of the subsegments of the array having length k (recall that a subsegment of a of length k is a contiguous part of a containing exactly k elements). If there is no integer occuring in all subsegments of length k for some value of k, then the k-amazing number is ?1.For each k from 1 to n calculate the k-amazing number of the array a.InputThe first line contains one integer t (1?t?1000) ? the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1?n?3?105) ? the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (1?ai?n) ? the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3?105.OutputFor each test case print n integers, where the i-th integer is equal to the i-amazing number of the array.ExampleInputCopy3, 5, 1 2 3 4 5, 5, 4 4 4 4 2, 6, 1 3 1 5 3 1, OutputCopy-1 -1 3 2 1 , -1 4 4 4 2 , -1 -1 1 1 1 1 , "
