b'E. Intersection of Permutationstime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two permutations aa and bb, both consisting of nn elements. Permutation of nn elements is such a integer sequence that each value from 11 to nn appears exactly once in it.You are asked to perform two types of queries with them:  1?la?ra?lb?rb1?la?ra?lb?rb ? calculate the number of values which appear in both segment [la;ra][la;ra] of positions in permutation aa and segment [lb;rb][lb;rb] of positions in permutation bb;  2?x?y2?x?y ? swap values on positions xx and yy in permutation bb. Print the answer for each query of the first type.It is guaranteed that there will be at least one query of the first type in the input.InputThe first line contains two integers nn and mm (2?n?2?1052?n?2?105, 1?m?2?1051?m?2?105) ? the number of elements in both permutations and the number of queries.The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,?,ana1,a2,?,an (1?ai?n1?ai?n) ? permutation aa. It is guaranteed that each value from 11 to nn appears in aa exactly once.The third line contains nn integers b1,b2,?,bnb1,b2,?,bn (1?bi?n1?bi?n) ? permutation bb. It is guaranteed that each value from 11 to nn appears in bb exactly once.Each of the next mm lines contains the description of a certain query. These are either:  1?la?ra?lb?rb1?la?ra?lb?rb (1?la?ra?n1?la?ra?n, 1?lb?rb?n1?lb?rb?n);  2?x?y2?x?y (1?x,y?n1?x,y?n, x?yx?y). OutputPrint the answers for the queries of the first type, each answer in the new line ? the number of values which appear in both segment [la;ra][la;ra] of positions in permutation aa and segment [lb;rb][lb;rb] of positions in permutation bb.ExampleInputCopy6 7, 5 1 4 2 3 6, 2 5 3 1 4 6, 1 1 2 4 5, 2 2 4, 1 1 2 4 5, 1 2 3 3 5, 1 1 6 1 2, 2 4 1, 1 4 4 1 3, OutputCopy1, 1, 1, 2, 0, NoteConsider the first query of the first example. Values on positions [1;2][1;2] of aa are [5,1][5,1] and values on positions [4;5][4;5] of bb are [1,4][1,4]. Only value 11 appears in both segments.After the first swap (the second query) permutation bb becomes [2,1,3,5,4,6][2,1,3,5,4,6].After the second swap (the sixth query) permutation bb becomes [5,1,3,2,4,6][5,1,3,2,4,6].'
