b'E. Minimum Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two arrays aa and b, both of length n. All elements of both arrays are from 0 to n?1.You can reorder elements of the array b (if you want, you may leave the order of elements as it is). After that, let array c be the array of length n, the i-th element of this array is ci=(ai+bi)%n, where x%y is x modulo y.Your task is to reorder elements of the array b to obtain the lexicographically minimum possible array c.Array x of length n is lexicographically less than array y of length n, if there exists such i (1?i?n), that xi<yi, and for any j (1?j<i) xj=yj.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer n (1?n?2?105) ? the number of elements in a, b and c.The second line of the input contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (0?ai<n), where ai is the i-th element of a.The third line of the input contains n integers b1,b2,?,bn (0?bi<n), where bi is the i-th element of b.OutputPrint the lexicographically minimum possible array c. Recall that your task is to reorder elements of the array b and obtain the lexicographically minimum possible array c, where the i-th element of c is ci=(ai+bi)%n.ExamplesInputCopy4, 0 1 2 1, 3 2 1 1, OutputCopy1 0 0 2 , InputCopy7, 2 5 1 5 3 4 3, 2 4 3 5 6 5 1, OutputCopy0 0 0 1 0 2 4 , '
