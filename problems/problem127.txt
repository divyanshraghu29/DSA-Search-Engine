b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a grid of (not necessarily non-negative) integers GG with NN rows and M columns. Let's denote the integer in the cell (i,j) of this grid by Gi,j; the rows and columns use 1-based indexing.\nFormally, let's call a non-empty subset of cells of the grid a plus sign if:\n\nit is connected\nthere is a central cell (i,j) which belongs to the subset\neach other (non-central) cell from the subset is either in row i or column j\nthe central cell is adjacent to 4 other cells in all 4 directions\n\nYou should find the maximum possible sum of integers written in the cells belonging to a plus sign in the grid.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nN lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines contains M space-separated integers Gi,1,Gi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Gi,M.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum sum of a plus sign. \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe sum of N in all test cases does not exceed 1,000\nthe sum of M in all test cases does not exceed 1,000\n|Gi,j|\xe2\x89\xa41,000,000 for each valid i,j\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nthe sum of N in all test cases does not exceed 100\nthe sum of M in all test cases does not exceed 100\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 4\n1 1 1 1\n-6 1 1 -4\n1 1 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PLUS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 2D Arrays, Pre processing, Bottom-up, Kadane Algorithm\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP Approach, Greedy\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2177\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-05-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
