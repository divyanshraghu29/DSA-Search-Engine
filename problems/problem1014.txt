b"F. Colored Treetime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou're given a tree with nn vertices. The color of the ii-th vertex is hihi.The value of the tree is defined as ?hi=hj,1?i<j?ndis(i,j), where dis(i,j) is the number of edges on the shortest path between i and j. The color of each vertex is lost, you only remember that hi can be any integer from [li,ri](inclusive). You want to calculate the sum of values of all trees meeting these conditions modulo 109+7 (the set of edges is fixed, but each color is unknown, so there are n?i=1(ri?li+1) different trees).InputThe first line contains one integer n (2?n?105) ? the number of vertices.Then n lines follow, each line contains two integers li and ri (1?li?ri?105) denoting the range of possible colors of vertex i.Then n?1 lines follow, each containing two integers u and v (1?u,v?n, u?v) denoting an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.OutputPrint one integer ? the sum of values of all possible trees, taken modulo 109+7.ExampleInputCopy4, 1 1, 1 2, 1 1, 1 2, 1 2, 1 3, 3 4, OutputCopy22, NoteIn the first example there are four different ways to color the tree (so, there are four different trees):  a tree with vertices colored as follows: {1,1,1,1}. The value of this tree is dis(1,2)+dis(1,3)+dis(1,4)+dis(2,3)+dis(2,4)+dis(3,4)=10;  a tree with vertices colored as follows: {1,2,1,1}. The value of this tree is dis(1,3)+dis(1,4)+dis(3,4)=4;  a tree with vertices colored as follows: {1,1,1,2}. The value of this tree is dis(1,2)+dis(1,3)+dis(2,3)=4;  a tree with vertices colored as follows: {1,2,1,2}. The value of this tree is dis(1,3)+dis(2,4)=4. Overall the sum of all values is 10+4+4+4=22."
