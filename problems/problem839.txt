Line Distancetime limit per test7.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer kk and nn distinct points with integer coordinates on the Euclidean plane, the ii-th point has coordinates (xi,yi).Consider a list of all the n(n?1)2 pairs of points ((xi,yi),(xj,yj)) (1?i<j?n). For every such pair, write out the distance from the line through these two points to the origin (0,0).Your goal is to calculate the k-th smallest number among these distances.InputThe first line contains two integers n, k (2?n?105, 1?k?n(n?1)2).The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers xi and yi (?104?xi,yi?104) ?? the coordinates of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that all given points are pairwise distinct.OutputYou should output one number?? the k-th smallest distance from the origin. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10?6.Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if |a?b|max(1,|b|)?10?6.ExampleInputCopy4 3, 2 1, -2 -1, 0 -1, -2 4, OutputCopy0.707106780737, NoteThere are 6 pairs of points:   Line 1?2 : distance 0 from the origin  Line 1?3 : distance ?22?0.707106781 from the origin  Line 1?4 : distance 2 from the origin  Line 2?3 : distance 1 from the origin  Line 2?4 : distance 2 from the origin  Line 3?4 : distance 2?29?0.371390676 from the origin  The third smallest distance among those is approximately 0.707106781."
