b"D. Beautiful Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array aa consisting of n integers. Beauty of array is the maximum sum of some consecutive subarray of this array (this subarray may be empty). For example, the beauty of the array [10, -5, 10, -4, 1] is 15, and the beauty of the array [-3, -5, -1] is 0.You may choose at most one consecutive subarray of a and multiply all values contained in this subarray by x. You want to maximize the beauty of array after applying at most one such operation.InputThe first line contains two integers n and x (1?n?3?105,?100?x?100) ? the length of array a and the integer x respectively.The second line contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (?109?ai?109) ? the array a.OutputPrint one integer ? the maximum possible beauty of array a after multiplying all values belonging to some consecutive subarray x.ExamplesInputCopy5 -2, -3 8 -2 1 -6, OutputCopy22, InputCopy12 -3, 1 3 3 7 1 3 3 7 1 3 3 7, OutputCopy42, InputCopy5 10, -1 -2 -3 -4 -5, OutputCopy0, NoteIn the first test case we need to multiply the subarray [-2, 1, -6], and the array becomes [-3, 8, 4, -2, 12] with beauty 22 ([-3, 8, 4, -2, 12]).In the second test case we don't need to multiply any subarray at all.In the third test case no matter which subarray we multiply, the beauty of array will be equal to 0."
