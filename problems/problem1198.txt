In this mission, Juliana has a rooted tree with nn vertices. Vertex number 11 is the root of this tree. Each vertex can be either black or white. At first, all vertices are white. Juliana is asked to process qq queries. Each query is one of three types:  If vertex vv is white, mark it as black; otherwise, perform this operation on all direct sons of vv instead.  Mark all vertices in the subtree of vv (including v) as white.  Find the color of the i-th vertex.   An example of operation "1 1" (corresponds to the first example test). The vertices 1 and 2 are already black, so the operation goes to their sons instead. Can you help Juliana to process all these queries?InputThe first line contains two integers n and q (2?n?105, 1?q?105)?? the number of vertices and the number of queries.The second line contains n?1 integers p2,p3,?,pn (1?pi<i), where pi means that there is an edge between vertices i and pi. Each of the next q lines contains two integers ti and vi (1?ti?3, 1?vi?n)?? the type of the i-th query and the vertex of the i-th query.It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.OutputFor each query of type 3, print "black" if the vertex is black; otherwise, print "white".ExamplesInputCopy8 101 2 1 2 5 4 51 23 23 11 11 13 53 73 42 23 5OutputCopyblackwhiteblackwhiteblackwhiteInputCopy8 111 1 2 3 3 6 61 11 11 33 23 43 63 72 31 63 73 6OutputCopyblackwhiteblackwhitewhiteblackNoteThe first example is shown on the picture below.
