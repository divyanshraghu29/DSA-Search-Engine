Minimal String Xorationtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer nn and a string ss consisting of 2n2n lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The characters of the string s are s0s1s2?s2n?1.A string t of length 2n (whose characters are denoted by t0t1t2?t2n?1) is a xoration of s if there exists an integer j (0?j?2n?1) such that, for each 0?i?2n?1, ti=si?j (where ? denotes the operation bitwise XOR).Find the lexicographically minimal xoration of s.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds:   a is a prefix of b, but a?b;  in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.  InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1?n?18).The second line contains a string s consisting of 2n lowercase letters of the English alphabet.OutputPrint a single line containing the lexicographically minimal xoration of s.ExamplesInputCopy2, acba, OutputCopyabca, InputCopy3, bcbaaabb, OutputCopyaabbbcba, InputCopy4, bdbcbccdbdbaaccd, OutputCopyabdbdccacbdbdccb, InputCopy5, ccfcffccccccffcfcfccfffffcccccff, OutputCopycccccffffcccccffccfcffcccccfffff, InputCopy1, zz, OutputCopyzz, NoteIn the first test, the lexicographically minimal xoration t of s="acba" is "abca". It\'s a xoration because, for j=3,   t0=s0?j=s3= "a";  t1=s1?j=s2= "b";  t2=s2?j=s1= "c";  t3=s3?j=s0= "a".  There isn\'t any xoration of s lexicographically smaller than "abca".In the second test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing j=4 in the definition of xoration.In the third test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing j=11 in the definition of xoration.In the fourth test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing j=10 in the definition of xoration.In the fifth test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing either j=0 or j=1 in the definition of xoration.'
