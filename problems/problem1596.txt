Let's number the tree vertexes with integers from 1 to n. The tree root is in the vertex 1.Each vertex (except fot the tree root) v has a direct ancestor pv. Also each vertex v has its integer value sv. Your task is to perform following queries:  P v u (u???v). If u isn't in subtree of v, you must perform the assignment pv?=?u. Otherwise you must perform assignment pu?=?v. Note that after this query the graph continues to be a tree consisting of n vertexes. V v t. Perform assignment sv?=?t. Your task is following. Before starting performing queries and after each query you have to calculate expected value written on the lowest common ancestor of two equiprobably selected vertices i and j. Here lowest common ancestor of i and j is the deepest vertex that lies on the both of the path from the root to vertex i and the path from the root to vertex j. Please note that the vertices i and j can be the same (in this case their lowest common ancestor coincides with them).InputThe first line of the input contains integer n (2???n???5?104) ? the number of the tree vertexes. The second line contains n?-?1 integer p2,?p3,?...,?pn (1???pi???n) ? the description of the tree edges. It is guaranteed that those numbers form a tree.The third line contains n integers ? s1,?s2,?... sn (0???si???106) ? the values written on each vertex of the tree.The next line contains integer q (1???q???5?104) ? the number of queries. Each of the following q lines contains the description of the query in the format described in the statement. It is guaranteed that query arguments u and v lie between 1 and n. It is guaranteed that argument t in the queries of type V meets limits 0???t???106.OutputPrint q?+?1 number ? the corresponding expected values. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10?-?9.ExamplesInputCopy51 2 2 11 2 3 4 55P 3 4P 4 5V 2 3P 5 2P 1 4OutputCopy1.6400000001.8000000002.2800000002.3200000002.8000000001.840000000NoteNote that in the query P v u if u lies in subtree of v you must perform assignment pu?=?v.
