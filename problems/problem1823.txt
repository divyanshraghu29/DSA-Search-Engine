b'C. Circular RMQtime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given circular array a0,?a1,?...,?an?-?1. There are two types of operations with it:   inc(lf,?rg,?v) ? this operation increases each element on the segment [lf,?rg] (inclusively) by v;  rmq(lf,?rg) ? this operation returns minimal value on the segment [lf,?rg] (inclusively). Assume segments to be circular, so if n?=?5 and lf?=?3,?rg?=?1, it means the index sequence: 3,?4,?0,?1.Write program to process given sequence of operations.InputThe first line contains integer n (1???n???200000). The next line contains initial state of the array: a0,?a1,?...,?an?-?1 (?-?106???ai???106), ai are integer. The third line contains integer m (0???m???200000), m ? the number of operartons. Next m lines contain one operation each. If line contains two integer lf,?rg (0???lf,?rg???n?-?1) it means rmq operation, it contains three integers lf,?rg,?v (0???lf,?rg???n?-?1;?-?106???v???106) ? inc operation.OutputFor each rmq operation write result for it. Please, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).ExamplesInputCopy41 2 3 443 03 0 -10 12 1OutputCopy100'
