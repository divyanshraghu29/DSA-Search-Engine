For given array a, indexed with integers from 1 to n, and number y, GukiZiana(a,?y) represents maximum value of j?-?i, such that aj?=?ai?=?y. If there is no y as an element in a, then GukiZiana(a,?y) is equal to ?-?1. GukiZ also prepared a problem for you. This time, you have two types of queries:   First type has form 1 l r x and asks you to increase values of all ai such that l???i???r by the non-negative integer x.  Second type has form 2 y and asks you to find value of GukiZiana(a,?y). For each query of type 2, print the answer and make GukiZ happy!InputThe first line contains two integers n, q (1???n???5?*?105,?1???q???5?*?104), size of array a, and the number of queries. The second line contains n integers a1,?a2,?... an (1???ai???109), forming an array a. Each of next q lines contain either four or two numbers, as described in statement:If line starts with 1, then the query looks like 1 l r x (1???l???r???n, 0???x???109), first type query.If line starts with 2, then th query looks like 2 y (1???y???109), second type query.OutputFor each query of type 2, print the value of GukiZiana(a,?y), for y value for that query.ExamplesInputCopy4 31 2 3 41 1 2 11 1 1 12 3OutputCopy2InputCopy2 31 21 2 2 12 32 4OutputCopy0-1'
