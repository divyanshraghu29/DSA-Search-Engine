Each edge has some letter written on it.You have to answer q queries. Each query is described by 4 integers u, v, l and r. The answer to the query is the total number of occurrences of str(u,v) in strings with indices from l to r. str(u,v) is defined as the string that is made by concatenating letters written on the edges on the shortest path from u to v (in order that they are traversed).InputThe first line of the input contains three integers n, m and q (2?n?105, 1?m,q?105).The i-th of the following n?1 lines contains two integers ui,vi and a lowercase Latin letter ci (1?ui,vi?n, ui?vi), denoting the edge between nodes ui,vi with a character ci on it. It's guaranteed that these edges form a tree.The following m lines contain the strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The total length of those strings does not exceed 105.Then q lines follow, each containing four integers u, v, l and r (1?u,v?n, u?v, 1?l?r?m), denoting the queries. OutputFor each query print a single integer ? the answer to the query.ExamplesInputCopy2 5 3, 1 2 a, aab, abab, aaa, b, a, 2 1 1 5, 1 2 1 3, 2 1 3 5, OutputCopy8, 7, 4, InputCopy9 5 6, 1 2 a, 2 7 c, 1 3 b, 3 4 b, 4 6 b, 3 5 a, 5 8 b, 5 9 c, ababa, cabbb, bac, bbbac, abacaba, 2 7 1 4, 2 5 1 5, 6 3 4 4, 6 9 4 5, 5 7 3 5, 5 3 1 5, OutputCopy3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 10, "
