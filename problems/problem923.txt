b"E. DeadLeetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLee bought some food for dinner time, but Lee's friends eat dinner in a deadly way. Lee is so scared, he doesn't want to die, at least not before seeing Online IOI 2020...There are nn different types of food and m Lee's best friends. Lee has wi plates of the i-th type of food and each friend has two different favorite types of food: the i-th friend's favorite types of food are xi and yi (xi?yi).Lee will start calling his friends one by one. Whoever is called will go to the kitchen and will try to eat one plate of each of his favorite food types. Each of the friends will go to the kitchen exactly once.The only problem is the following: if a friend will eat at least one plate of food (in total) then he will be harmless. But if there is nothing left for him to eat (neither xi nor yi), he will eat Lee instead ?_?.Lee can choose the order of friends to call, so he'd like to determine if he can survive dinner or not. Also, he'd like to know the order itself.InputThe first line contains two integers n and m (2?n?105; 1?m?2?105)?? the number of different food types and the number of Lee's friends. The second line contains n integers w1,w2,?,wn (0?wi?106)?? the number of plates of each food type.The i-th line of the next m lines contains two integers xi and yi (1?xi,yi?n; xi?yi)?? the favorite types of food of the i-th friend. OutputIf Lee can survive the dinner then print ALIVE (case insensitive), otherwise print DEAD (case insensitive).Also, if he can survive the dinner, print the order Lee should call friends. If there are multiple valid orders, print any of them.ExamplesInputCopy3 3, 1 2 1, 1 2, 2 3, 1 3, OutputCopyALIVE, 3 2 1 , InputCopy3 2, 1 1 0, 1 2, 1 3, OutputCopyALIVE, 2 1 , InputCopy4 4, 1 2 0 1, 1 3, 1 2, 2 3, 2 4, OutputCopyALIVE, 1 3 2 4 , InputCopy5 5, 1 1 1 2 1, 3 4, 1 2, 2 3, 4 5, 4 5, OutputCopyALIVE, 5 4 1 3 2 , InputCopy4 10, 2 4 1 4, 3 2, 4 2, 4 1, 3 1, 4 1, 1 3, 3 2, 2 1, 3 1, 2 4, OutputCopyDEAD, NoteIn the first example, any of the following orders of friends are correct : [1,3,2], [3,1,2], [2,3,1], [3,2,1].In the second example, Lee should call the second friend first (the friend will eat a plate of food 1) and then call the first friend (the friend will eat a plate of food 2). If he calls the first friend sooner than the second one, then the first friend will eat one plate of food 1 and food 2 and there will be no food left for the second friend to eat."
