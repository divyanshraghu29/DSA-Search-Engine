b"E. Tokitsukaze and Beautiful Subsegmentstime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTokitsukaze has a permutation pp of length nn.Let's call a segment [l,r][l,r] beautiful if there exist i and j satisfying pi?pj=max{pl,pl+1,?,pr}, where l?i<j?r.Now Tokitsukaze has q queries, in the i-th query she wants to know how many beautiful subsegments [x,y] there are in the segment [li,ri] (i.?e. li?x?y?ri).InputThe first line contains two integers n and q (1?n?2?105; 1?q?106)?? the length of permutation p and the number of queries.The second line contains n distinct integers p1,p2,?,pn (1?pi?n)?? the permutation p.Each of the next q lines contains two integers li and ri (1?li?ri?n)?? the segment [li,ri] of this query.OutputFor each query, print one integer?? the numbers of beautiful subsegments in the segment [li,ri].ExamplesInputCopy8 3, 1 3 5 2 4 7 6 8, 1 3, 1 1, 1 8, OutputCopy2, 0, 10, InputCopy10 10, 6 1 3 2 5 8 4 10 7 9, 1 8, 1 10, 1 2, 1 4, 2 4, 5 8, 4 10, 4 7, 8 10, 5 9, OutputCopy17, 25, 1, 5, 2, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, NoteIn the first example, for the first query, there are 2 beautiful subsegments??
