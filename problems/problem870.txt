Find any good tuple for each x1 from 1 to n inclusive.InputThe first line contains two integers n and m (1?n,m?2?105).The second line contains two integers l and r (1?l?r?nm).OutputFor each x1 from 1 to n inclusive:   if there are no such four integers, print ?1;  otherwise, print four integers x1, y1, x2 and y2. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
