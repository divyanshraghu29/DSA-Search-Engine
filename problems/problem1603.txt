b"E. Pillarstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMarmot found a row with n pillars. The i-th pillar has the height of hi meters. Starting from one pillar i1, Marmot wants to jump on the pillars i2, ..., ik. (1???i1?<?i2?<?...?<?ik???n). From a pillar i Marmot can jump on a pillar j only if i?<?j and |hi?-?hj|???d, where |x| is the absolute value of the number x.Now Marmot is asking you find out a jump sequence with maximal length and print it.InputThe first line contains two integers n and d (1???n???105, 0???d???109).The second line contains n numbers h1,?h2,?...,?hn (1???hi???1015).OutputThe first line should contain one integer k, the maximal length of a jump sequence.The second line should contain k integers i1,?i2,?...,?ik (1???i1?<?i2?<?...?<?ik???n), representing the pillars' indices from the maximal length jump sequence.If there is more than one maximal length jump sequence, print any.ExamplesInputCopy5 21 3 6 7 4OutputCopy41 2 3 5 InputCopy10 32 1 3 6 9 11 7 3 20 18OutputCopy61 4 6 7 8 9 NoteIn the first example Marmot chooses the pillars 1, 2, 3, 5 with the heights 1, 3, 6, 4.
