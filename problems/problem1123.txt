Please, another Queries on Array?time limit per test5.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array a1,a2,?,ana1,a2,?,an.You need to perform q queries of the following two types:  "MULTIPLY l r x"?? for every i (l?i?r) multiply ai by x. "TOTIENT l r"?? print ?(r?i=lai) taken modulo 109+7, where ? denotes Euler\'s totient function. The Euler\'s totient function of a positive integer n (denoted as ?(n)) is the number of integers x (1?x?n) such that gcd(n,x)=1.InputThe first line contains two integers n and q (1?n?4?105, 1?q?2?105)?? the number of elements in array a and the number of queries.The second line contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (1?ai?300)?? the elements of array a.Then q lines follow, describing queries in the format given in the statement.  "MULTIPLY l r x" (1?l?r?n, 1?x?300)?? denotes a multiplication query. "TOTIENT l r" (1?l?r?n)?? denotes a query on the value of Euler\'s totient function. It is guaranteed that there is at least one "TOTIENT" query.OutputFor each "TOTIENT" query, print the answer to it.ExampleInputCopy4 45 9 1 2TOTIENT 3 3TOTIENT 3 4MULTIPLY 4 4 3TOTIENT 4 4OutputCopy112NoteIn the first example, ?(1)=1 for the first query, ?(2)=1 for the second query and ?(6)=2 for the third one.'
