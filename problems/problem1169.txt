b'E. Split the Treetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a rooted tree on nn vertices, its root is the vertex number 11. The ii-th vertex contains a number wiwi. Split it into the minimum possible number of vertical paths in such a way that each path contains no more than LL vertices and the sum of integers wiwi on each path does not exceed SS. Each vertex should belong to exactly one path.A vertical path is a sequence of vertices v1,v2,?,vkv1,v2,?,vk where vivi (i?2i?2) is the parent of vi?1vi?1.InputThe first line contains three integers nn, LL, SS (1?n?1051?n?105, 1?L?1051?L?105, 1?S?10181?S?1018)?? the number of vertices, the maximum number of vertices in one path and the maximum sum in one path.The second line contains nn integers w1,w2,?,wnw1,w2,?,wn (1?wi?1091?wi?109)?? the numbers in the vertices of the tree.The third line contains n?1n?1 integers p2,?,pnp2,?,pn (1?pi<i1?pi<i), where pipi is the parent of the ii-th vertex in the tree.OutputOutput one number ?? the minimum number of vertical paths. If it is impossible to split the tree, output ?1?1.ExamplesInputCopy3 1 31 2 31 1OutputCopy3InputCopy3 3 61 2 31 1OutputCopy2InputCopy1 1 1000010001OutputCopy-1NoteIn the first sample the tree is split into {1},?{2},?{3}{1},?{2},?{3}.In the second sample the tree is split into {1,?2},?{3}{1,?2},?{3} or {1,?3},?{2}{1,?3},?{2}.In the third sample it is impossible to split the tree.'
