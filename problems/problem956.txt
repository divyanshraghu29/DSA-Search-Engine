AND Segmentstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three integers nn, k, m and m conditions (l1,r1,x1),(l2,r2,x2),?,(lm,rm,xm).Calculate the number of distinct arrays a, consisting of n integers such that:   0?ai<2k for each 1?i?n;  bitwise AND of numbers a[li]&a[li+1]&?&a[ri]=xi for each 1?i?m. Two arrays a and b are considered different if there exists such a position i that ai?bi. The number can be pretty large so print it modulo 998244353.InputThe first line contains three integers n, k and m (1?n?5?105, 1?k?30, 0?m?5?105) ? the length of the array a, the value such that all numbers in a should be smaller than 2k and the number of conditions, respectively.Each of the next m lines contains the description of a condition li, ri and xi (1?li?ri?n, 0?xi<2k) ? the borders of the condition segment and the required bitwise AND value on it.OutputPrint a single integer ? the number of distinct arrays a that satisfy all the above conditions modulo 998244353.ExamplesInputCopy4 3 2, 1 3 3, 3 4 6, OutputCopy3, InputCopy5 2 3, 1 3 2, 2 5 0, 3 3 3, OutputCopy33, NoteYou can recall what is a bitwise AND operation here.In the first example, the answer is the following arrays: [3,3,7,6], [3,7,7,6] and [7,3,7,6].'
