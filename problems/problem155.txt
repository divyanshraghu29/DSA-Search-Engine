Each city has its own traditional dish for which it is famous; let's denote the tastiness of the dish in city i by Ai.\nChef is currently learning how to prepare tastier dishes. At any point, he can only remember how to cook one dish. Initially, the tastiness of the dish he can cook is W. Chef is going to travel from city 1 to city v. In each city he visits (including 1 and v), if the tastiness of the traditional dish of this city is strictly greater than the tastiness of the dish he can currently cook, then he forgets the dish he can currently cook and learns the traditional dish of this city.\nNow, Chef is wondering how many times he is going to learn a new dish during his trip. You should answer Q independent queries. In each query, you are given the initial tastiness W and Chef's final destination v; compute the number of times Chef learns a new dish. Note that the input is given in a special format, so you have to answer the queries online.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer N. \nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe third line contains N\xe2\x88\x921 space-separated integers P2,P3,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN, meaning there's an edge between i and Pi.\nThe fourth line contains one integer Q. \nEach of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers A and B describing a query in the following format:\nLet's denote the answer to the previous query by Pr (Pr=0 if this is the first query).\nFor this query, v=A\xe2\x8a\x95Pr and W=B\xe2\x8a\x95Pr.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of times Chef learns a new dish.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4108 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x88\x921 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa4108\n1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 106\nthe sum of Q for all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n2 3 1 4 5\n1 2 2 3\n2\n2 1\n1 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dolabmoon\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Pre processing, Dynamic Programming, DFS, Binary lifting\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, Lowest Common Ancestor\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2715\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-09-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
