b'E. Yaroslav and Pointstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYaroslav has n points that lie on the Ox axis. The coordinate of the first point is x1, the coordinate of the second point is x2, ..., the coordinate of the n-th point is ? xn. Now Yaroslav wants to execute m queries, each of them is of one of the two following types:  Move the pj-th point from position xpj to position xpj?+?dj. At that, it is guaranteed that after executing such query all coordinates of the points will be distinct.  Count the sum of distances between all pairs of points that lie on the segment [lj,?rj] (lj???rj). In other words, you should count the sum of: . Help Yaroslav.InputThe first line contains integer n ? the number of points (1???n???105). The second line contains distinct integers x1,?x2,?...,?xn ? the coordinates of points (|xi|???109).The third line contains integer m ? the number of queries (1???m???105). The next m lines contain the queries. The j-th line first contains integer tj (1???tj???2) ? the query type. If tj?=?1, then it is followed by two integers pj and dj (1???pj???n,?|dj|???1000). If tj?=?2, then it is followed by two integers lj and rj (?-?109???lj???rj???109).It is guaranteed that at any moment all the points have distinct coordinates.OutputFor each type 2 query print the answer on a single line. Print the answers in the order, in which the queries follow in the input.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams of the %I64d specifier.ExamplesInputCopy836 50 28 -75 40 -60 -95 -48202 -61 291 5 -531 1 4291 5 1302 -101 -712 -69 531 1 4041 5 5182 -101 532 50 8721 1 -2072 -99 -401 7 -3891 6 -1711 2 4641 7 -7071 1 -7301 1 5602 635 6441 7 -677OutputCopy17620406104616381560'
