Find the expected value of P(A).\nFor each valid n, it can be proved that the expected value can be expressed as a fraction P/Q, where P and Q are positive integers and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353, where Q\xe2\x88\x921 is the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 998,244,353.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, K, L and R.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353 for n=i.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4106\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of K over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2 2 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 748683266\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: For n=1, we have P([1])=P([2])=1 and P(A)=0 for any other sequence. Hence, the expected value is 2/2=1.\nFor n=2, there are four valid sequences [1,1], [1,2], [2,1] and [2,2]. Each of them can be split into one-element subsequences. In addition, [1,1] can be left unchanged (split into only one subsequence), so P([1,1])=2. The expected value is (2+1+1+1)/4=5/4=748,683,266.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85krikti\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PART\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 FFT, NTT, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Transformations, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2988\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
