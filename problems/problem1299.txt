The c-th cell in the r-th row is denoted by (r,?c).Oshino places and removes barriers around rectangular areas of cells. Specifically, an action denoted by "1 r1 c1 r2 c2" means Oshino\'s placing barriers around a rectangle with two corners being (r1,?c1) and (r2,?c2) and sides parallel to squares sides. Similarly, "2 r1 c1 r2 c2" means Oshino\'s removing barriers around the rectangle. Oshino ensures that no barriers staying on the ground share any common points, nor do they intersect with boundaries of the n???m area.Sometimes Koyomi tries to walk from one cell to another carefully without striding over barriers, in order to avoid damaging various items on the ground. "3 r1 c1 r2 c2" means that Koyomi tries to walk from (r1,?c1) to (r2,?c2) without crossing barriers.And you\'re here to tell Koyomi the feasibility of each of his attempts.InputThe first line of input contains three space-separated integers n, m and q (1???n,?m???2?500, 1???q???100?000) ? the number of rows and columns in the grid, and the total number of Oshino and Koyomi\'s actions, respectively.The following q lines each describes an action, containing five space-separated integers t, r1, c1, r2, c2 (1???t???3, 1???r1,?r2???n, 1???c1,?c2???m) ? the type and two coordinates of an action. Additionally, the following holds depending on the value of t:   If t?=?1: 2???r1???r2???n?-?1, 2???c1???c2???m?-?1;  If t?=?2: 2???r1???r2???n?-?1, 2???c1???c2???m?-?1, the specified group of barriers exist on the ground before the removal.  If t?=?3: no extra restrictions. OutputFor each of Koyomi\'s attempts (actions with t?=?3), output one line ? containing "Yes" (without quotes) if it\'s feasible, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.ExamplesInputCopy5 6 51 2 2 4 51 3 3 3 33 4 4 1 12 2 2 4 53 1 1 4 4OutputCopyNoYesInputCopy2500 2500 81 549 1279 1263 21891 303 795 1888 24321 2227 622 2418 11613 771 2492 1335 14331 2017 2100 2408 21603 48 60 798 7291 347 708 1868 7923 1940 2080 377 1546OutputCopyNoYesNoNoteFor the first example, the situations of Koyomi\'s actions are illustrated below.
