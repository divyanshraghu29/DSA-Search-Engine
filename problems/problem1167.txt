Two subsequences are considered different if index sets of numbers included in them are different. That is, the values ?of the elements ?do not matter in the comparison of subsequences. In particular, the array aa has exactly 2n?12n?1 different subsequences (excluding an empty subsequence).InputThe first line contains an integer nn (1?n?1000001?n?100000)?? the length of the array aa.The next line contains integers a1,a2,?,ana1,a2,?,an (1?ai?1061?ai?106).OutputPrint exactly one integer?? the number of good subsequences taken modulo 109+7109+7.ExamplesInputCopy21 2OutputCopy3InputCopy52 2 1 22 14OutputCopy13NoteIn the first example, all three non-empty possible subsequences are good: {1}{1}, {1,2}{1,2}, {2}{2}In the second example, the possible good subsequences are: {2}{2}, {2,2}{2,2}, {2,22}{2,22}, {2,14}{2,14}, {2}{2}, {2,22}{2,22}, {2,14}{2,14}, {1}{1}, {1,22}{1,22}, {1,14}{1,14}, {22}{22}, {22,14}{22,14}, {14}{14}.Note, that some subsequences are listed more than once, since they occur in the original array multiple times.'
