b'C. Lucky Ticketstime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn Walrusland public transport tickets are characterized by two integers: by the number of the series and by the number of the ticket in the series. Let the series number be represented by a and the ticket number ? by b, then a ticket is described by the ordered pair of numbers (a,?b). The walruses believe that a ticket is lucky if a?*?b?=?rev(a)?*?rev(b). The function rev(x) reverses a number written in the decimal system, at that the leading zeroes disappear. For example, rev(12343)?=?34321, rev(1200)?=?21.The Public Transport Management Committee wants to release x series, each containing y tickets, so that at least w lucky tickets were released and the total number of released tickets (x?*?y) were minimum. The series are numbered from 1 to x inclusive. The tickets in each series are numbered from 1 to y inclusive. The Transport Committee cannot release more than maxx series and more than maxy tickets in one series.InputThe first line contains three integers maxx, maxy, w (1???maxx,?maxy???105, 1???w???107).OutputPrint on a single line two space-separated numbers, the x and the y. If there are several possible variants, print any of them. If such x and y do not exist, print a single number ?-?1.ExamplesInputCopy2 2 1OutputCopy1 1InputCopy132 10 35OutputCopy7 5InputCopy5 18 1000OutputCopy-1InputCopy48 132 235OutputCopy22 111'
