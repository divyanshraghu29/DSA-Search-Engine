b"D. Jeff and Removing Periodstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputCosider a sequence, consisting of n integers: a1, a2, ..., an. Jeff can perform the following operation on sequence a:  take three integers v, t, k (1???v,?t???n;?0???k;?v?+?tk???n), such that av = av?+?t, av?+?t = av?+?2t, ..., av?+?t(k?-?1) = av?+?tk;  remove elements av, av?+?t, ..., av?+?t?k from the sequence a, the remaining elements should be reindexed a1,?a2,?...,?an?-?k?-?1.  permute in some order the remaining elements of sequence a. A beauty of a sequence a is the minimum number of operations that is needed to delete all elements from sequence a.Jeff's written down a sequence of m integers b1, b2, ..., bm. Now he wants to ask q questions. Each question can be described with two integers li,?ri. The answer to the question is the beauty of sequence bli, bli?+?1, ..., bri. You are given the sequence b and all questions. Help Jeff, answer all his questions.InputThe first line contains integer m (1???m???105). The next line contains m integers b1, b2, ..., bm (1???bi???105). The third line contains integer q (1???q???105) ? the number of questions. The next q lines contain pairs of integers, i-th of them contains a pair of integers li, ri (1???li???ri???m) ? the description of i-th question.OutputIn q lines print the answers to Jeff's queries. Print the answers according to the order of questions in input.ExamplesInputCopy52 2 1 1 251 51 12 21 32 3OutputCopy21122InputCopy102 1 3 3 3 3 1 3 1 1104 82 101 104 41 32 46 71 92 51 1OutputCopy2331322321"
