Total score is 0 if there were no rolls.Limak made n rolls and got score ai for i-th of them. He wants to maximize his total score and he came up with an interesting idea. He will cancel some rolls, saying that something distracted him or there was a strong wind.Limak is able to cancel any number of rolls, maybe even all or none of them. Total score is calculated as if there were only non-canceled rolls. Look at the sample tests for clarification. What maximum total score can Limak get?InputThe first line contains single integer n (1???n???105).The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,?a2,?...,?an (|ai|???107) - scores for Limak's rolls.OutputPrint the maximum possible total score after choosing rolls to cancel.ExamplesInputCopy5-2 -8 0 5 -3OutputCopy13InputCopy6-10 20 -30 40 -50 60OutputCopy400NoteIn first sample Limak should cancel rolls with scores ?-?8 and ?-?3.
