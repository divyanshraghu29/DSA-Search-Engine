b'E. Analysis of Pathes in Functional Graphtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a functional graph. It is a directed graph, in which from each vertex goes exactly one arc. The vertices are numerated from 0 to n?-?1.Graph is given as the array f0,?f1,?...,?fn?-?1, where fi ? the number of vertex to which goes the only arc from the vertex i. Besides you are given array with weights of the arcs w0,?w1,?...,?wn?-?1, where wi ? the arc weight from i to fi.  The graph from the first sample test. Also you are given the integer k (the length of the path) and you need to find for each vertex two numbers si and mi, where:  si ? the sum of the weights of all arcs of the path with length equals to k which starts from the vertex i;  mi ? the minimal weight from all arcs on the path with length k which starts from the vertex i. The length of the path is the number of arcs on this path.InputThe first line contains two integers n,?k (1???n???105,?1???k???1010). The second line contains the sequence f0,?f1,?...,?fn?-?1 (0???fi?<?n) and the third ? the sequence w0,?w1,?...,?wn?-?1 (0???wi???108).OutputPrint n lines, the pair of integers si, mi in each line.ExamplesInputCopy7 31 2 3 4 3 2 66 3 1 4 2 2 3OutputCopy10 18 17 110 28 27 19 3InputCopy4 40 1 2 30 1 2 3OutputCopy0 04 18 212 3InputCopy5 31 2 3 4 04 1 2 14 3OutputCopy7 117 119 221 38 1'
