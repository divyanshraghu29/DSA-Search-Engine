b'E. Eye-Pleasing City Park Tourtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a city park represented as a tree with nn attractions as its vertices and n?1n?1 rails as its edges. The ii-th attraction has happiness value aiai.Each rail has a color. It is either black if ti=0ti=0, or white if ti=1ti=1. Black trains only operate on a black rail track, and white trains only operate on a white rail track. If you are previously on a black train and want to ride a white train, or you are previously on a white train and want to ride a black train, you need to use 11 ticket.The path of a tour must be a simple path ? it must not visit an attraction more than once. You do not need a ticket the first time you board a train. You only have kk tickets, meaning you can only switch train types at most kk times. In particular, you do not need a ticket to go through a path consisting of one rail color.Define f(u,v)f(u,v) as the sum of happiness values of the attractions in the tour (u,v)(u,v), which is a simple path that starts at the uu-th attraction and ends at the vv-th attraction. Find the sum of f(u,v)f(u,v) for all valid tours (u,v)(u,v) (1?u?v?n1?u?v?n) that does not need more than kk tickets, modulo 109+7109+7.InputThe first line contains two integers nn and kk (2?n?2?1052?n?2?105, 0?k?n?10?k?n?1) ? the number of attractions in the city park and the number of tickets you have.The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,?,ana1,a2,?,an (0?ai?1090?ai?109) ? the happiness value of each attraction.The ii-th of the next n?1n?1 lines contains three integers uiui, vivi, and titi (1?ui,vi?n1?ui,vi?n, 0?ti?10?ti?1) ? an edge between vertices uiui and vivi with color titi. The given edges form a tree.OutputOutput an integer denoting the total happiness value for all valid tours (u,v)(u,v) (1?u?v?n1?u?v?n), modulo 109+7109+7.ExamplesInputCopy5 0, 1 3 2 6 4, 1 2 1, 1 4 0, 3 2 1, 2 5 0, OutputCopy45, InputCopy3 1, 1 1 1, 1 2 1, 3 2 0, OutputCopy10, '
