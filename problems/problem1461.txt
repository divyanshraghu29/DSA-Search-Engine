There are n train stations in the city, and at the i-th station it's possible to buy only tickets to stations from i?+?1 to ai inclusive. No tickets are sold at the last station.Let ?i,?j be the minimum number of tickets one needs to buy in order to get from stations i to station j. As Vasya is fond of different useless statistic he asks you to compute the sum of all values ?i,?j among all pairs 1???i?<?j???n.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2???n???100?000)?? the number of stations.The second line contains n?-?1 integer ai (i?+?1???ai???n), the i-th of them means that at the i-th station one may buy tickets to each station from i?+?1 to ai inclusive.OutputPrint the sum of ?i,?j among all pairs of 1???i?<?j???n.ExamplesInputCopy44 4 4OutputCopy6InputCopy52 3 5 5OutputCopy17NoteIn the first sample it's possible to get from any station to any other (with greater index) using only one ticket. The total number of pairs is 6, so the answer is also 6.Consider the second sample:   ?1,?2?=?1  ?1,?3?=?2  ?1,?4?=?3  ?1,?5?=?3  ?2,?3?=?1  ?2,?4?=?2  ?2,?5?=?2  ?3,?4?=?1  ?3,?5?=?1  ?4,?5?=?1 Thus the answer equals 1?+?2?+?3?+?3?+?1?+?2?+?2?+?1?+?1?+?1?=?17."
