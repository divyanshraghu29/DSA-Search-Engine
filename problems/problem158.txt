b'\nGiven a sequence X of length M, f(X) is defined as f(X)=\xe2\x88\x91M\xe2\x88\x921i=1|Xi+1\xe2\x88\x92Xi|. \nSpecifically, if M = 1, then f(X) = 0.\nFor e.g., f([3, 1, 7, 2]) = |1-3| + |7-1| + |2-7| = 13\nJJ has an array A of length N. He wants to divide the array A into two subsequences P and Q (possibly empty) such that the value of f(P) + f(Q) is as large as possible. (Note that each A_i must belong to either subsequence P or subsequence Q).\nHelp him find this maximum value of f(P) + f(Q).\nNote: A sequence X is a subsequence of a sequence Y if X can be obtained from Y by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array A.\nThe second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N denoting the array A.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput the largest value of f(P) + f(Q).\nConstraints\n\n1 \\leq T \\leq 200\n1 \\leq N \\leq 1000\n1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^5\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3000.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n6\n1 4 6 3 4 2\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n2\n1 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n11\n6\n9\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case-1: One way to divide the array into two subsequences P and Q as follows: \nP = [1, 6, 2], Q = [4, 3, 4]. \nf(P) = |6 - 1| + |2 - 6| = 9 and f(Q) = |3 - 4| + |4 - 3| = 2. \nTherefore f(P) + f(Q) = 11. \nIt can be proven that this is the maximum value of f(P) + f(Q).\nTest case-2: One way to divide the array into two subsequences P and Q as follows: \nP = [1, 4], Q = [2, 3, 5]. \nf(P) = |4 - 1|= 3 and f(Q) = |3 - 2| + |5 - 3| = 3. \nTherefore f(P) + f(Q) = 6. \nIt can be proven that this is the maximum value of f(P) + f(Q).\nTest case-3: One way to divide the array into two subsequences P and Q as follows: \nP = [1, 10], Q = []. \nf(P) = |10 - 1| = 9 and f(Q) = 0. \nTherefore f(P) + f(Q) = 9. \nIt can be proven that this is the maximum value of f(P) + f(Q).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85jeevanjyot\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DIVIDEARR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy-medium, jeevanjyot, start26\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2631\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-02-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
