Travelling Salesman Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are n cities numbered from 1 to n, and city i has beauty ai.A salesman wants to start at city 1, visit every city exactly once, and return to city 1.For all i?j, a flight from city i to city j costs max(ci,aj?ai) dollars, where ci is the price floor enforced by city i. Note that there is no absolute value. Find the minimum total cost for the salesman to complete his trip.InputThe first line contains a single integer n (2?n?105) ? the number of cities.The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers ai, ci (0?ai,ci?109) ? the beauty and price floor of the i-th city.OutputOutput a single integer ? the minimum total cost.ExamplesInputCopy3, 1 9, 2 1, 4 1, OutputCopy11, InputCopy6, 4 2, 8 4, 3 0, 2 3, 7 1, 0 1, OutputCopy13, NoteIn the first test case, we can travel in order 1?3?2?1.   The flight 1?3 costs max(c1,a3?a1)=max(9,4?1)=9.  The flight 3?2 costs max(c3,a2?a3)=max(1,2?4)=1.  The flight 2?1 costs max(c2,a1?a2)=max(1,1?2)=1. The total cost is 11, and we cannot do better.'
