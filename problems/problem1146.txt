b"F. Ehab and a weird weight formulatime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou're given a tree consisting of nn nodes. Every node uu has a weight auau. It is guaranteed that there is only one node with minimum weight in the tree. For every node uu (except for the node with the minimum weight), it must have a neighbor vv such that av<auav<au. You should construct a tree to minimize the weight ww calculated as follows:  For every node uu, degu?audegu?au is added to ww (degudegu is the number of edges containing node uu).  For every edge {u,v}{u,v}, ?log2(dist(u,v))??min(au,av)?log2(dist(u,v))??min(au,av) is added to ww, where dist(u,v)dist(u,v) is the number of edges in the path from uu to vv in the given tree. InputThe first line contains the integer nn (2?n?5?105)(2?n?5?105), the number of nodes in the tree.The second line contains nn space-separated integers a1,a2,?,ana1,a2,?,an (1?ai?109)(1?ai?109), the weights of the nodes.The next n?1n?1 lines, each contains 2 space-separated integers uu and vv (1?u,v?n)(1?u,v?n) which means there's an edge between uu and vv.OutputOutput one integer, the minimum possible value for ww.ExamplesInputCopy31 2 31 21 3OutputCopy7InputCopy54 5 3 7 81 21 33 44 5OutputCopy40NoteIn the first sample, the tree itself minimizes the value of ww.In the second sample, the optimal tree is:"
