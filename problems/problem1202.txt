b'D. Antstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test768 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a tree with nn vertices. There are also mm ants living on it. Each ant has its own color. The ii-th ant has two favorite pairs of vertices: (ai,bi) and (ci,di). You need to tell if it is possible to paint the edges of the tree in m colors so that every ant will be able to walk between vertices from one of its favorite pairs using only edges of his color; if it is possible, you need to print which pair every ant should use.InputThe first line contains a single integer n (2?n?105)?? the number of vertices.Each of the next n?1 lines contains two integers ui and vi (1?ui,vi?n), meaning that there is an edge between vertices ui and vi.The next line contains a single integer m (1?m?104)?? the number of ants.Each of the next m lines contains four integers ai, bi, ci, and di (1?ai,bi,ci,di?n, ai?bi,ci?di), meaning that pairs (ai, bi) and (ci, di) are favorite for the i-th ant.OutputPrint "NO" (without quotes) if the wanted painting is impossible.Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes). Print m lines. On the i-th line, print 1 if the i-th ant will use the first pair and 2 otherwise. If there are multiple answers, print any.ExamplesInputCopy61 23 14 15 26 232 6 3 41 6 6 51 4 5 2OutputCopyYES212InputCopy51 21 31 41 522 3 4 53 4 5 2OutputCopyNONoteIn the sample, the second and the third edge should be painted in the first color, the first and the fifth should be painted in the second color, and the fourth should be painted in the third color.'
