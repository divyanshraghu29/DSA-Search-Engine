b"D. Petya and Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPetya has an array aa consisting of nn integers. He has learned partial sums recently, and now he can calculate the sum of elements on any segment of the array really fast. The segment is a non-empty sequence of elements standing one next to another in the array.Now he wonders what is the number of segments in his array with the sum less than tt. Help Petya to calculate this number.More formally, you are required to calculate the number of pairs l,r (l?r) such that al+al+1+?+ar?1+ar<t.InputThe first line contains two integers n and t (1?n?200000,|t|?2?1014).The second line contains a sequence of integers a1,a2,?,an (|ai|?109) ? the description of Petya's array. Note that there might be negative, zero and positive elements.OutputPrint the number of segments in Petya's array with the sum of elements less than t.ExamplesInputCopy5 45 -1 3 4 -1OutputCopy5InputCopy3 0-1 2 -3OutputCopy4InputCopy4 -1-2 1 -2 3OutputCopy3NoteIn the first example the following segments have sum less than 4:  [2,2], sum of elements is ?1  [2,3], sum of elements is 2  [3,3], sum of elements is 3  [4,5], sum of elements is 3  [5,5], sum of elements is ?1 "
