b"F. Dominant Indicestime limit per test4.5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a rooted undirected tree consisting of nn vertices. Vertex 11 is the root.Let's denote a depth array of vertex xx as an infinite sequence [dx,0,dx,1,dx,2,?][dx,0,dx,1,dx,2,?], where dx,i is the number of vertices y such that both conditions hold:  x is an ancestor of y;  the simple path from x to y traverses exactly i edges. The dominant index of a depth array of vertex x (or, shortly, the dominant index of vertex x) is an index j such that:  for every k<j, dx,k<dx,j;  for every k>j, dx,k?dx,j. For every vertex in the tree calculate its dominant index.InputThe first line contains one integer n (1?n?106) ? the number of vertices in a tree.Then n?1 lines follow, each containing two integers x and y (1?x,y?n, x?y). This line denotes an edge of the tree.It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.OutputOutput n numbers. i-th number should be equal to the dominant index of vertex i.ExamplesInputCopy41 22 33 4OutputCopy0000InputCopy41 21 31 4OutputCopy1000InputCopy41 22 32 4OutputCopy2100"
