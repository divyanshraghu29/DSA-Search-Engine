After adding each vetex, find some clique of K\xe2\x88\x921 vertices in the graph and connect the new vertex to all the vertices of that clique.\n\nConsider N boolean variables X1,X2,\xe2\x80\xa6,XN and their negations \xc2\xacX1,\xc2\xacX2,\xe2\x80\xa6,\xc2\xacXN, corresponding to vertices of the graph. You are given the initial values of all variables.\nA CNF boolean expression is defined as a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of two or more elements of the set of variables and their negations.\nUsing the graph G, Ada wrote a CNF boolean expression B with M clauses, where each clause corresponds to a clique in the graph with some (maybe none) of the variables (corresponding to vertices) negated. More formally, for each i from 1 to M:\n\nAda chose some clique in the graph, consisting of Li vertices Z1,Z2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ZLi\nthen for each valid j, Ada chose a variable Pi,j as either XZj or \xc2\xacXZj\nthe i-th clause in the expression B had Li terms: Pi,1\xe2\x88\xa8Pi,2\xe2\x88\xa8\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x88\xa8Pi,Li\n\nAda wants the expression to evaluate to "true". In order to achieve that, she may change the values of variables; for each valid i, the cost of changing the value of Xi (from "true" to "false" or vice versa) is Ci. Find the minimum total cost needed to make the expression B evaluate to "true" or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.\nThe second line contains a single binary string S with length N describing the initial values of the variables. For each valid i, the i-th character of S is \'1\' if Xi is true or \'0\' if Xi is false.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers C1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CN.\nM lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains an integer Li followed by a space and Li space-separated integers representing the variables Pi,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Pi,Li. For each valid i, the variable Xi is represented by the integer i and its negation is represented by \xe2\x88\x92i.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum cost needed to make the boolean expression evaluate to "true", or \xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4144\n3\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa49\neach character of S is either \'0\' or \'1\'\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa4256 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|Pi,j|\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i,j\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (25 points, time limit 1 second): K=3\nSubtask #2 (75 points, time limit 6 seconds): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 3 3\n00001\n1 4 2 3 7\n3 1 -2 4\n3 2 3 -5\n3 1 -3 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The following figure depicts the graph used to generate the expression.\n\nThe boolean expression is B=(X1\xe2\x88\xa8\xc2\xacX2\xe2\x88\xa8X4)\xe2\x88\xa7(X2\xe2\x88\xa8X3\xe2\x88\xa8\xc2\xacX5)\xe2\x88\xa7(X1\xe2\x88\xa8\xc2\xacX3\xe2\x88\xa8X2).\nOne optimal solution is to change the values of X1 and X3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CCNF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Graphs, Trees, 2 SAT, Dynamic Programming, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3160\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-03-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 6 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
