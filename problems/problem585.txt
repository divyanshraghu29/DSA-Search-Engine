b'B. Optimal Partitiontime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array aa consisting of nn integers. You should divide aa into continuous non-empty subarrays (there are 2n?1 ways to do that).Let s=al+al+1+?+ar. The value of a subarray al,al+1,?,ar is:   (r?l+1) if s>0, 0 if s=0, ?(r?l+1) if s<0.  What is the maximum sum of values you can get with a partition?InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1?t?5?105) ? the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1?n?5?105).The second line of each test case contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (?109?ai?109).It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5?105.OutputFor each test case print a single integer ? the maximum sum of values you can get with an optimal parition.ExampleInputCopy5, 3, 1 2 -3, 4, 0 -2 3 -4, 5, -1 -2 3 -1 -1, 6, -1 2 -3 4 -5 6, 7, 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1, OutputCopy1, 2, 1, 6, -1, NoteTest case 1: one optimal partition is [1,2], [?3]. 1+2>0 so the value of [1,2] is 2. ?3<0, so the value of [?3] is ?1. 2+(?1)=1.Test case 2: the optimal partition is [0,?2,3], [?4], and the sum of values is 3+(?1)=2.'
