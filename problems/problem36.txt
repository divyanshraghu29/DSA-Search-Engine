b'\nChef is playing a game on a sequence of NN positive integers, say A1,A2,...ANA1,A2,...AN The game is played as follows.\n\nIf all the numbers are equal, the game ends.\nOtherwise\nSelect two numbers which are unequal\nSubtract the smaller number from the larger number\nReplace the larger number with the result from above\n\nChef has already figured out that the game always terminates. He also knows, for a given sequence of integers, the game will always terminate on the same value, no matter how the game is played. Chef wants you to simulate the game for him and tell him if the game terminates on 11.\nIn fact, there may be many such games. Given a sequence of integers Chef wants to know the number of sub-sequences of the given sequence, for which, playing the above game on the subsuquence will terminate on 1. A sub-sequence can be obtained from the original sequence by deleting 0 or more integers from the original sequence. See the explanation section for clarity.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then follow the description of T test cases. \nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the length of the sequence. \nThe second line contains N positive integers, each separated by a single space.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer - the number of sub-sequences of the original sequence, such that, playing the game on the sub-sequence results in ending the game with all the values equal to 1.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa460 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4104 \nAll Ai will be distinct.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\n2 3 5 7\n4\n3 4 8 16\n3\n6 10 15\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n11\n7\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: The following 11 sub-sequences are counted.\n\n{2,3}\n{2,5}\n{2,7}\n{3,5}\n{3,7}\n{5,7}\n{2,3,5}\n{2,3,7}\n{2,5,7}\n{3,5,7}\n{2,3,5,7}\n\nTest Case 2: The following 7 sub-sequences are counted.\n\n{3,4}\n{3,8}\n{3,16}\n{3,4,8}\n{3,4,16}\n{3,8,16}\n{3,4,8,16}\n\nTest Case 3: There are 8 subsequences of {6,10,15}\n\n{} => The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence\n{6} => The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence\n{10} => The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence\n{15} => The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence\n{6,10} => The game cannot end at {1,1}\n{6,15} => The game cannot end at {1,1}\n{10,15} => The game cannot end at {1,1}\n{6,10,15} => The game ends at {1,1,1}.
