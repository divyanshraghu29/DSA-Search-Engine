In the i-th operation, you have a symbol si which is either "<" or ">" and a number xi.You make a new array b such that bj=?aj if ajsixi and bj=aj otherwise (i.e. if si is \'>\', then all aj>xi will be flipped). After doing all these replacements, a is set to be b.You want to know what your final array looks like after all operations.InputThe first line contains two integers n,q (1?n,q?105)?? the number of integers and the number of queries.The next line contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (?105?ai?105)?? the numbers.Each of the next q lines contains a character and an integer si,xi. (si?{<,>},?105?xi?105)?? the queries.OutputPrint n integers c1,c2,?,cn representing the array after all operations.ExamplesInputCopy11 3, -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5, > 2, > -4, < 5, OutputCopy5 4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 -3 4 5, InputCopy5 5, 0 1 -2 -1 2, < -2, < -1, < 0, < 1, < 2, OutputCopy0 -1 2 -1 2, NoteIn the first example, the array goes through the following changes:   Initial: [?5,?4,?3,?2,?1,0,1,2,3,4,5]  >2: [?5,?4,?3,?2,?1,0,1,2,?3,?4,?5]  >?4: [?5,?4,3,2,1,0,?1,?2,3,?4,?5]  <5: [5,4,?3,?2,?1,0,1,2,?3,4,5] '
