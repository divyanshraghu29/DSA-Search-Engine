b'C. Appleman and a Sheet of Papertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAppleman has a very big sheet of paper. This sheet has a form of rectangle with dimensions 1???n. Your task is help Appleman with folding of such a sheet. Actually, you need to perform q queries. Each query will have one of the following types:  Fold the sheet of paper at position pi. After this query the leftmost part of the paper with dimensions 1???pi must be above the rightmost part of the paper with dimensions 1???([current?width?of?sheet]?-?pi).  Count what is the total width of the paper pieces, if we will make two described later cuts and consider only the pieces between the cuts. We will make one cut at distance li from the left border of the current sheet of paper and the other at distance ri from the left border of the current sheet of paper. Please look at the explanation of the first test example for better understanding of the problem.InputThe first line contains two integers: n and q (1????n???105;?1???q???105) ? the width of the paper and the number of queries.Each of the following q lines contains one of the described queries in the following format:  "1 pi" (1???pi?<?[current?width?of?sheet]) ? the first type query.  "2 li ri" (0???li?<?ri???[current?width?of?sheet]) ? the second type query. OutputFor each query of the second type, output the answer.ExamplesInputCopy7 41 31 22 0 12 1 2OutputCopy43InputCopy10 92 2 91 12 0 11 82 0 81 22 1 31 42 2 4OutputCopy721045NoteThe pictures below show the shapes of the paper during the queries of the first example:  After the first fold operation the sheet has width equal to 4, after the second one the width of the sheet equals to 2.'
