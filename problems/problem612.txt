All cells are colored in white initially.q operations have been applied to the sheet. The i-th of them can be described as follows:   xi yi?? choose one of k non-white colors and color the entire row xi and the entire column yi in it. The new color is applied to each cell, regardless of whether the cell was colored before the operation. The sheet after applying all q operations is called a coloring. Two colorings are different if there exists at least one cell that is colored in different colors.How many different colorings are there? Print the number modulo 998244353.InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1?t?104)?? the number of testcases.The first line of the testcase contains four integers n,m,k and q (1?n,m,k,q?2?105)?? the size of the sheet, the number of non-white colors and the number of operations.The i-th of the following q lines contains a description of the i-th operation?? two integers xi and yi (1?xi?n; 1?yi?m)?? the row and the column the operation is applied to.The sum of q over all testcases doesn't exceed 2?105.OutputFor each testcase, print a single integer?? the number of different colorings modulo 998244353.ExampleInputCopy2, 1 1 3 2, 1 1, 1 1, 2 2 2 3, 2 1, 1 1, 2 2, OutputCopy3, 4, "
