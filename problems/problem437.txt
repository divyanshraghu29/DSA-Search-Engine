She put Jack in a grid with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). There are K cheese wedges scattered over the grid; for each wedge, we know how long it takes Jack to eat it.\nLet's denote the cell in row r and column c by (r,c). Initially, Jack is in the cell (1,1). When Jack is in a cell (r,c), he can move to either of the cells (r,c\xe2\x88\x921) or (r,c+1) in 1 second. If he is in the first or last column of the grid (c=1 or c=M), he can also move to the cell (r+1,c) in 1 second. Jack can only eat a cheese wedge if he is in the same cell as the wedge.\nYour task is to help Jack find out, for each possible i, the minimum number of seconds Jack needs to eat i cheese wedges.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.\nK lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers r, c and t, denoting that there is a cheese wedge in cell (r,c) and it takes Jack t seconds to eat it.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing K space-separated integers. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K), the i-th of them should denote the minimum number of seconds Jack needs to eat i cheese wedges.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N\n2\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x88\x921\n1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4109\nno two cheese wedges are in the same cell\nthe sum of K over all test cases does not exceed 104\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (25 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\nN,M,K\xe2\x89\xa4300\n\nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 10 5\n1 2 10\n2 2 1\n1 3 1\n1 9 1 \n2 9 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 8 14 22 32\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85watcher\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MMC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2678\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
