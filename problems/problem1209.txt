b'C. Covered Points Counttime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given nn segments on a coordinate line; each endpoint of every segment has integer coordinates. Some segments can degenerate to points. Segments can intersect with each other, be nested in each other or even coincide.Your task is the following: for every k?[1..n]k?[1..n], calculate the number of points with integer coordinates such that the number of segments that cover these points equals kk. A segment with endpoints li and ri covers point x if and only if li?x?ri.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer n (1?n?2?105) ? the number of segments.The next n lines contain segments. The i-th line contains a pair of integers li,ri (0?li?ri?1018) ? the endpoints of the i-th segment.OutputPrint n space separated integers cnt1,cnt2,?,cntn, where cnti is equal to the number of points such that the number of segments that cover these points equals to i.ExamplesInputCopy30 31 33 8OutputCopy6 2 1 InputCopy31 32 45 7OutputCopy5 2 0 NoteThe picture describing the first example:Points with coordinates [0,4,5,6,7,8] are covered by one segment, points [1,2] are covered by two segments and point [3] is covered by three segments.The picture describing the second example:Points [1,4,5,6,7] are covered by one segment, points [2,3] are covered by two segments and there are no points covered by three segments.'
