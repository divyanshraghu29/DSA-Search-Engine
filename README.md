# INTRODUCTION
This repository is a part of a project whose problem statement is based on creating a Search Engine for Data Structures and Algorith Problems with the help of Tf-Idf Algorithm.
# TF-IDF
This Algorithm is based on the vector space model wherein each document is tokenized into a vector who's indices correspond to a unique term in an input query/document. Subsequently, we caclulate the TF-IDF for each term formula in the document vector, where TF-IDF is defined to be:
