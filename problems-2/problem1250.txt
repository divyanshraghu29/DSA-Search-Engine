In particular, if one segment ends in a point x, and another segment starts in the point x, these two segments belong to the same connected component.InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1???n???200?000) ? the number of segments.The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers li and ri (1???li?<?ri???109) ? the coordinates of the left and the right ends of the i-th segment. The segments are listed in the order they are added on the white line.OutputPrint n integers ? the number of connected components of black segments after each segment is added.

The third added segment intersects the left segment and touches the right segment at the point 4 (these segments belong to the same component, according to the statements). Thus the number of connected components of black segments is equal to 1 after that.'
