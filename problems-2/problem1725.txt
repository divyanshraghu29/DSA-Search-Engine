b"E. Little Elephant and Treetime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe Little Elephant loves trees very much, he especially loves root trees.He's got a tree consisting of n nodes (the nodes are numbered from 1 to n), with root at node number 1. Each node of the tree contains some list of numbers which initially is empty. The Little Elephant wants to apply m operations. On the i-th operation (1???i???m) he first adds number i to lists of all nodes of a subtree with the root in node number ai, and then he adds number i to lists of all nodes of the subtree with root in node bi.After applying all operations the Little Elephant wants to count for each node i number ci ? the number of integers j (1???j???n;?j???i), such that the lists of the i-th and the j-th nodes contain at least one common number.Help the Little Elephant, count numbers ci for him.InputThe first line contains two integers n and m (1???n,?m???105) ? the number of the tree nodes and the number of operations. Each of the following n?-?1 lines contains two space-separated integers, ui and vi (1???ui,?vi???n,?ui???vi), that mean that there is an edge between nodes number ui and vi. Each of the following m lines contains two space-separated integers, ai and bi (1???ai,?bi???n,?ai???bi), that stand for the indexes of the nodes in the i-th operation.It is guaranteed that the given graph is an undirected tree.OutputIn a single line print n space-separated integers ? c1,?c2,?...,?cn.ExamplesInputCopy5 11 21 33 53 42 3OutputCopy0 3 3 3 3 InputCopy11 31 22 32 41 55 65 75 86 98 108 112 93 62 8OutputCopy0 6 7 6 0 2 0 5 4 5 5 "
