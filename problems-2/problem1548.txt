After that he connected all the points pairwise and saw that as a result many triangles were formed with vertices in the painted points. He asks you to count the number of the formed triangles with the non-zero area.InputThe first line contains integer n (1???n???2000) ? the number of the points painted on the plane. Next n lines contain two integers each xi,?yi (?-?100???xi,?yi???100) ? the coordinates of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that no two given points coincide.OutputIn the first line print an integer ? the number of triangles with the non-zero area among the painted points.ExamplesInputCopy40 01 12 02 2OutputCopy3InputCopy30 01 12 0OutputCopy1InputCopy11 1OutputCopy0NoteNote to the first sample test. There are 3 triangles formed: (0,?0)?-?(1,?1)?-?(2,?0); (0,?0)?-?(2,?2)?-?(2,?0); (1,?1)?-?(2,?2)?-?(2,?0).Note to the second sample test. There is 1 triangle formed: (0,?0)?-?(1,?1)?-?(2,?0).Note to the third sample test. A single point doesn't form a single triangle."
