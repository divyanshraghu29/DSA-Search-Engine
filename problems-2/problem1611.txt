Of course she wants her partner to be clever too (although he's not)! Parmida has prepared the following test problem for Pashmak.There is a sequence a that consists of n integers a1,?a2,?...,?an. Let's denote f(l,?r,?x) the number of indices k such that: l???k???r and ak?=?x. His task is to calculate the number of pairs of indicies i,?j (1???i?<?j???n) such that f(1,?i,?ai)?>?f(j,?n,?aj).Help Pashmak with the test.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer n (1???n???106). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,?a2,?...,?an (1???ai???109).OutputPrint a single integer ? the answer to the problem.ExamplesInputCopy71 2 1 1 2 2 1OutputCopy8InputCopy31 1 1OutputCopy1InputCopy51 2 3 4 5OutputCopy0"
