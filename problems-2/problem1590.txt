b'E. Touriststime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are n cities in Cyberland, numbered from 1 to n, connected by m bidirectional roads. The j-th road connects city aj and bj.For tourists, souvenirs are sold in every city of Cyberland. In particular, city i sell it at a price of wi.Now there are q queries for you to handle. There are two types of queries: "C a w": The price in city a is changed to w. "A a b": Now a tourist will travel from city a to b. He will choose a route, he also doesn\'t want to visit a city twice. He will buy souvenirs at the city where the souvenirs are the cheapest (possibly exactly at city a or b). You should output the minimum possible price that he can buy the souvenirs during his travel.More formally, we can define routes as follow: A route is a sequence of cities [x1,?x2,?...,?xk], where k is a certain positive integer. For any 1???i?<?j???k,?xi???xj. For any 1???i?<?k, there is a road connecting xi and xi?+?1. The minimum price of the route is min(wx1,?wx2,?...,?wxk). The required answer is the minimum value of the minimum prices of all valid routes from a to b.InputThe first line of input contains three integers n,?m,?q (1???n,?m,?q???105), separated by a single space.Next n lines contain integers wi (1???wi???109).Next m lines contain pairs of space-separated integers aj and bj (1???aj,?bj???n,?aj???bj).It is guaranteed that there is at most one road connecting the same pair of cities. There is always at least one valid route between any two cities.Next q lines each describe a query. The format is "C a w" or "A a b" (1???a,?b???n,?1???w???109).OutputFor each query of type "A", output the corresponding answer.ExamplesInputCopy3 3 31231 22 31 3A 2 3C 1 5A 2 3OutputCopy12InputCopy7 9 412345671 22 51 52 33 42 45 66 75 7A 2 3A 6 4A 6 7A 3 3OutputCopy2153NoteFor the second sample, an optimal routes are:From 2 to 3 it is [2,?3].From 6 to 4 it is [6,?5,?1,?2,?4].From 6 to 7 it is [6,?5,?7].From 3 to 3 it is [3].
