b"D. Mishka and Interesting sumtime limit per test3.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLittle Mishka enjoys programming. Since her birthday has just passed, her friends decided to present her with array of non-negative integers a1,?a2,?...,?an of n elements!Mishka loved the array and she instantly decided to determine its beauty value, but she is too little and can't process large arrays. Right because of that she invited you to visit her and asked you to process m queries.Each query is processed in the following way:  Two integers l and r (1???l???r???n) are specified?? bounds of query segment.  Integers, presented in array segment [l,??r] (in sequence of integers al,?al?+?1,?...,?ar) even number of times, are written down.  XOR-sum of written down integers is calculated, and this value is the answer for a query. Formally, if integers written down in point 2 are x1,?x2,?...,?xk, then Mishka wants to know the value , where ?? operator of exclusive bitwise OR. Since only the little bears know the definition of array beauty, all you are to do is to answer each of queries presented.InputThe first line of the input contains single integer n (1???n???1?000?000)?? the number of elements in the array.The second line of the input contains n integers a1,?a2,?...,?an (1???ai???109)?? array elements.The third line of the input contains single integer m (1???m???1?000?000)?? the number of queries.Each of the next m lines describes corresponding query by a pair of integers l and r (1???l???r???n)?? the bounds of query segment.OutputPrint m non-negative integers?? the answers for the queries in the order they appear in the input.ExamplesInputCopy33 7 811 3OutputCopy0InputCopy71 2 1 3 3 2 354 74 51 31 71 5OutputCopy03132NoteIn the second sample:There is no integers in the segment of the first query, presented even number of times in the segment?? the answer is 0.In the second query there is only integer 3 is presented even number of times?? the answer is 3.In the third query only integer 1 is written down?? the answer is 1.In the fourth query all array elements are considered. Only 1 and 2 are presented there even number of times. The answer is .In the fifth query 1 and 3 are written down. The answer is ."
