LIS of Sequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe next "Data Structures and Algorithms" lesson will be about Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS for short) of a sequence. For better understanding, Nam decided to learn it a few days before the lesson.Nam created a sequence a consisting of n (1???n???105) elements a1,?a2,?...,?an (1???ai???105). A subsequence ai1,?ai2,?...,?aik where 1???i1?<?i2?<?...?<?ik???n is called increasing if ai1?<?ai2?<?ai3?<?...?<?aik. An increasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing subsequences. Nam realizes that a sequence may have several longest increasing subsequences. Hence, he divides all indexes i (1???i???n), into three groups: group of all i such that ai belongs to no longest increasing subsequences. group of all i such that ai belongs to at least one but not every longest increasing subsequence. group of all i such that ai belongs to every longest increasing subsequence. Since the number of longest increasing subsequences of a may be very large, categorizing process is very difficult. Your task is to help him finish this job.InputThe first line contains the single integer n (1???n???105) denoting the number of elements of sequence a.The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,?a2,?...,?an (1???ai???105).OutputPrint a string consisting of n characters. i-th character should be \'1\', \'2\' or \'3\' depending on which group among listed above index i belongs to.ExamplesInputCopy14OutputCopy3InputCopy41 3 2 5OutputCopy3223InputCopy41 5 2 3OutputCopy3133NoteIn the second sample, sequence a consists of 4 elements: {a1,?a2,?a3,?a4} = {1,?3,?2,?5}. Sequence a has exactly 2 longest increasing subsequences of length 3, they are {a1,?a2,?a4} = {1,?3,?5} and {a1,?a3,?a4} = {1,?2,?5}.In the third sample, sequence a consists of 4 elements: {a1,?a2,?a3,?a4} = {1,?5,?2,?3}. Sequence a have exactly 1 longest increasing subsequence of length 3, that is {a1,?a3,?a4} = {1,?2,?3}.'
