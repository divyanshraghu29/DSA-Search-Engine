Each vertex i has its own value ai. All vertices are connected in series by edges. Formally, for every 1?i<n there is an edge between the vertices of i and i+1.Denote the function f(l,r), which takes two integers l and r (l?r): ?? We leave in the tree only vertices whose values ??range from l to r. ?? The value of the function will be the number of connected components in the new graph. Your task is to calculate the following sum: n?l=1n?r=lf(l,r)InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1?n?105)?? the number of vertices in the tree.The second line contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (1?ai?n)?? the values of the vertices.OutputPrint one number?? the answer to the problem.ExamplesInputCopy3, 2 1 3, OutputCopy7InputCopy4, 2 1 1 3, OutputCopy11InputCopy10, 1 5 2 5 5 3 10 6 5 1, OutputCopy104NoteIn the first example, the function values ??will be as follows:   f(1,1)=1 (there is only a vertex with the number 2, which forms one component)  f(1,2)=1 (there are vertices 1 and 2 that form one component)  f(1,3)=1 (all vertices remain, one component is obtained)  f(2,2)=1 (only vertex number 1)  f(2,3)=2 (there are vertices 1 and 3 that form two components)  f(3,3)=1 (only vertex 3)  Totally out 7.In the second example, the function values ??will be as follows:   f(1,1)=1  f(1,2)=1  f(1,3)=1  f(1,4)=1  f(2,2)=1  f(2,3)=2  f(2,4)=2  f(3,3)=1  f(3,4)=1  f(4,4)=0 (there is no vertex left, so the number of components is 0)  Totally out 11.'
