b"D. Yaroslav and Divisorstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYaroslav has an array p?=?p1,?p2,?...,?pn (1???pi???n), consisting of n distinct integers. Also, he has m queries:  Query number i is represented as a pair of integers li, ri (1???li???ri???n).  The answer to the query li,?ri is the number of pairs of integers q, w (li???q,?w???ri) such that pq is the divisor of pw. Help Yaroslav, answer all his queries.InputThe first line contains the integers n and m (1???n,?m???2?105). The second line contains n distinct integers p1,?p2,?...,?pn (1???pi???n). The following m lines contain Yaroslav's queries. The i-th line contains integers li,?ri (1???li???ri???n).OutputPrint m integers ? the answers to Yaroslav's queries in the order they appear in the input.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.ExamplesInputCopy1 111 1OutputCopy1InputCopy10 91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 101 102 93 84 75 62 29 105 104 10OutputCopy27148421279"
