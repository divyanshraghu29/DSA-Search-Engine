Today Petya bought a beautiful matrix aa of size n?nn?n, and now he wants to determine its rarity.The rarity of the matrix is its index in the list of beautiful matrices of size n?nn?n, sorted in lexicographical order. Matrix comparison is done row by row. (The index of lexicographically smallest matrix is zero).Since the number of beautiful matrices may be huge, Petya wants you to calculate the rarity of the matrix aa modulo 998244353998244353.InputThe first line contains one integer nn (1?n?20001?n?2000) ? the number of rows and columns in aa.Each of the next nn lines contains nn integers ai,jai,j (1?ai,j?n1?ai,j?n) ? the elements of aa.It is guaranteed that aa is a beautiful matrix.OutputPrint one integer ? the rarity of matrix aa, taken modulo 998244353998244353.ExamplesInputCopy2, 2 1, 1 2, OutputCopy1, InputCopy3, 1 2 3, 2 3 1, 3 1 2, OutputCopy1, InputCopy3, 1 2 3, 3 1 2, 2 3 1, OutputCopy3, NoteThere are only 22 beautiful matrices of size 2?22?2:  There are the first 55 beautiful matrices of size 3?33?3 in lexicographical order:  '
