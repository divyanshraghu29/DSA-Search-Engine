b"F. SUM and REPLACEtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet D(x) be the number of positive divisors of a positive integer x. For example, D(2)?=?2 (2 is divisible by 1 and 2), D(6)?=?4 (6 is divisible by 1, 2, 3 and 6).You are given an array a of n integers. You have to process two types of queries:  REPLACE l r ? for every  replace ai with D(ai);  SUM l r ? calculate . Print the answer for each SUM query.InputThe first line contains two integers n and m (1???n,?m???3?105) ? the number of elements in the array and the number of queries to process, respectively.The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1???ai???106) ? the elements of the array.Then m lines follow, each containing 3 integers ti, li, ri denoting i-th query. If ti?=?1, then i-th query is REPLACE li ri, otherwise it's SUM li ri (1???ti???2, 1???li???ri???n).There is at least one SUM query.OutputFor each SUM query print the answer to it.ExampleInputCopy7 66 4 1 10 3 2 42 1 72 4 51 3 52 4 41 5 72 1 7OutputCopy3013422"
