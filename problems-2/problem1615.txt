Determine whether there\'s a pair of integers a,?b (1???a,?b???n;?a???b) such that the element  (note, that it is usual division, not integer one) is between a and b in this permutation.InputFirst line consists of a single integer n (1???n???300000) ? the size of permutation.Second line contains n integers ? the permutation itself.OutputPrint "YES", if such a pair exists, "NO" otherwise (in both cases without quotes, the answer is case insensitive).ExamplesInputCopy41 3 4 2OutputCopyNOInputCopy51 5 2 4 3OutputCopyYESNoteIn the second example 2 is between 1 and 3. Additionally 4 is between 3 and 5.'
