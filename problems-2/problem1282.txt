b"F. Subtree Minimum Querytime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a rooted tree consisting of n vertices. Each vertex has a number written on it; number ai is written on vertex i.Let's denote d(i,?j) as the distance between vertices i and j in the tree (that is, the number of edges in the shortest path from i to j). Also let's denote the k-blocked subtree of vertex x as the set of vertices y such that both these conditions are met:  x is an ancestor of y (every vertex is an ancestor of itself);  d(x,?y)???k. You are given m queries to the tree. i-th query is represented by two numbers xi and ki, and the answer to this query is the minimum value of aj among such vertices j such that j belongs to ki-blocked subtree of xi.Write a program that would process these queries quickly!Note that the queries are given in a modified way.InputThe first line contains two integers n and r (1???r???n???100000) ? the number of vertices in the tree and the index of the root, respectively.The second line contains n integers a1,?a2,?...,?an (1???ai???109) ? the numbers written on the vertices.Then n?-?1 lines follow, each containing two integers x and y (1???x,?y???n) and representing an edge between vertices x and y. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.Next line contains one integer m (1???m???106) ? the number of queries to process.Then m lines follow, i-th line containing two numbers pi and qi, which can be used to restore i-th query (1???pi,?qi???n).i-th query can be restored as follows:Let last be the answer for previous query (or 0 if i?=?1). Then xi?=?((pi?+?last)?mod?n)?+?1, and ki?=?(qi?+?last)?mod?n.OutputPrint m integers. i-th of them has to be equal to the answer to i-th query.ExampleInputCopy5 21 3 2 3 52 35 13 44 121 22 3OutputCopy25"
