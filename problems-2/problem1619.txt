b'C. DZY Loves Colorstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDZY loves colors, and he enjoys painting.On a colorful day, DZY gets a colorful ribbon, which consists of n units (they are numbered from 1 to n from left to right). The color of the i-th unit of the ribbon is i at first. It is colorful enough, but we still consider that the colorfulness of each unit is 0 at first.DZY loves painting, we know. He takes up a paintbrush with color x and uses it to draw a line on the ribbon. In such a case some contiguous units are painted. Imagine that the color of unit i currently is y. When it is painted by this paintbrush, the color of the unit becomes x, and the colorfulness of the unit increases by |x?-?y|.DZY wants to perform m operations, each operation can be one of the following:  Paint all the units with numbers between l and r (both inclusive) with color x.  Ask the sum of colorfulness of the units between l and r (both inclusive). Can you help DZY?InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers n,?m?(1???n,?m???105).Each of the next m lines begins with a integer type?(1???type???2), which represents the type of this operation.If type?=?1, there will be 3 more integers l,?r,?x?(1???l???r???n;?1???x???108) in this line, describing an operation 1.If type?=?2, there will be 2 more integers l,?r?(1???l???r???n) in this line, describing an operation 2.OutputFor each operation 2, print a line containing the answer ? sum of colorfulness.ExamplesInputCopy3 31 1 2 41 2 3 52 1 3OutputCopy8InputCopy3 41 1 3 42 1 12 2 22 3 3OutputCopy321InputCopy10 61 1 5 31 2 7 91 10 10 111 3 8 121 1 10 32 1 10OutputCopy129NoteIn the first sample, the color of each unit is initially [1,?2,?3], and the colorfulness is [0,?0,?0].After the first operation, colors become [4,?4,?3], colorfulness become [3,?2,?0].After the second operation, colors become [4,?5,?5], colorfulness become [3,?3,?2].So the answer to the only operation of type 2 is 8.'
