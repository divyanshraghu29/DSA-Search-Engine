b'B. Friendstime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have n friends and you want to take m pictures of them. Exactly two of your friends should appear in each picture and no two pictures should contain the same pair of your friends. So if you have n?=?3 friends you can take 3 different pictures, each containing a pair of your friends.Each of your friends has an attractiveness level which is specified by the integer number ai for the i-th friend. You know that the attractiveness of a picture containing the i-th and the j-th friends is equal to the exclusive-or (xor operation) of integers ai and aj.You want to take pictures in a way that the total sum of attractiveness of your pictures is maximized. You have to calculate this value. Since the result may not fit in a 32-bit integer number, print it modulo 1000000007 (109?+?7).InputThe first line of input contains two integers n and m  ? the number of friends and the number of pictures that you want to take. Next line contains n space-separated integers a1,?a2,?...,?an (0???ai???109) ? the values of attractiveness of the friends.OutputThe only line of output should contain an integer ? the optimal total sum of attractiveness of your pictures.ExamplesInputCopy3 11 2 3OutputCopy3InputCopy3 21 2 3OutputCopy5InputCopy3 31 2 3OutputCopy6'
