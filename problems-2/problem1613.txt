Serega has fun by solving query problems. One day Fedor came up with such a problem.You are given an array a consisting of n positive integers and queries to it. The queries can be of two types:  Make a unit cyclic shift to the right on the segment from l to r (both borders inclusive). That is rearrange elements of the array in the following manner:a[l],?a[l?+?1],?...,?a[r?-?1],?a[r]???a[r],?a[l],?a[l?+?1],?...,?a[r?-?1]. Count how many numbers equal to k are on the segment from l to r (both borders inclusive). Fedor hurried to see Serega enjoy the problem and Serega solved it really quickly. Let's see, can you solve it?InputThe first line contains integer n (1???n???105) ? the number of elements of the array. The second line contains n integers a[1],?a[2],?...,?a[n] (1???a[i]???n).The third line contains a single integer q (1???q???105) ? the number of queries. The next q lines contain the queries.As you need to respond to the queries online, the queries will be encoded. A query of the first type will be given in format: 1 l'i r'i. A query of the second type will be given in format: 2 l'i r'i k'i. All the number in input are integer. They satisfy the constraints: 1???l'i,?r'i,?k'i???n.To decode the queries from the data given in input, you need to perform the following transformations:li?=?((l'i?+?lastans?-?1)?mod?n)?+?1;?ri?=?((r'i?+?lastans?-?1)?mod?n)?+?1;?ki?=?((k'i?+?lastans?-?1)?mod?n)?+?1.Where lastans is the last reply to the query of the 2-nd type (initially, lastans?=?0). If after transformation li is greater than ri, you must swap these values.OutputFor each query of the 2-nd type print the answer on a single line.ExamplesInputCopy76 6 2 7 4 2 571 3 62 2 4 22 2 4 72 2 2 51 2 61 1 42 1 7 3OutputCopy2100InputCopy88 4 2 2 7 7 8 881 8 82 8 1 71 8 11 7 32 8 8 31 1 41 2 71 4 5OutputCopy20"
