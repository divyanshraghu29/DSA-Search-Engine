There are no ends of some segments that coincide. For each segment find the number of segments it contains.InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1???n???2?105) ? the number of segments on a line.Each of the next n lines contains two integers li and ri (?-?109???li?<?ri???109) ? the coordinates of the left and the right ends of the i-th segment. It is guaranteed that there are no ends of some segments that coincide.OutputPrint n lines. The j-th of them should contain the only integer aj ? the number of segments contained in the j-th segment.ExamplesInputCopy41 82 34 75 6OutputCopy3010InputCopy33 41 52 6OutputCopy011'
