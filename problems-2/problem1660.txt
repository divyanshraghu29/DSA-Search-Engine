b'B. Sereja ans Anagramstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSereja has two sequences a and b and number p. Sequence a consists of n integers a1,?a2,?...,?an. Similarly, sequence b consists of m integers b1,?b2,?...,?bm. As usual, Sereja studies the sequences he has. Today he wants to find the number of positions q (q?+?(m?-?1)?p???n;?q???1), such that sequence b can be obtained from sequence aq,?aq?+?p,?aq?+?2p,?...,?aq?+?(m?-?1)p by rearranging elements.Sereja needs to rush to the gym, so he asked to find all the described positions of q.InputThe first line contains three integers n, m and p (1???n,?m???2?105,?1???p???2?105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1???ai???109). The next line contains m integers b1, b2, ..., bm (1???bi???109).OutputIn the first line print the number of valid qs. In the second line, print the valid values in the increasing order.ExamplesInputCopy5 3 11 2 3 2 11 2 3OutputCopy21 3InputCopy6 3 21 3 2 2 3 11 2 3OutputCopy21 2'
