Each user thus has a non-negative amount of friends.This morning, somebody anonymously sent Bob the following link: graph realization problem and Bob wants to know who that was. In order to do that, he first needs to know how the social network looks like. He investigated the profile of every other person on the network and noted down the number of his friends. However, he neglected to note down the number of his friends. Help him find out how many friends he has. Since there may be many possible answers, print all of them.InputThe first line contains one integer nn?(1?n?5?1051?n?5?105), the number of people on the network excluding Bob. The second line contains nn numbers a1,a2,?,ana1,a2,?,an?(0?ai?n0?ai?n), with aiai being the number of people that person ii is a friend of.OutputPrint all possible values of an+1an+1?? the amount of people that Bob can be friend of, in increasing order.If no solution exists, output ?1?1.ExamplesInputCopy33 3 3OutputCopy3 InputCopy41 1 1 1OutputCopy0 2 4 InputCopy20 2OutputCopy-1InputCopy3521 26 18 4 28 2 15 13 16 25 6 32 11 5 31 17 9 3 24 33 14 27 29 1 20 4 12 7 10 30 34 8 19 23 22OutputCopy13 15 17 19 21 NoteIn the first test case, the only solution is that everyone is friends with everyone. That is why Bob should have 33 friends.In the second test case, there are three possible solutions (apart from symmetries):   aa is friend of bb, cc is friend of dd, and Bob has no friends, or  aa is a friend of bb and both cc and dd are friends with Bob, or  Bob is friends of everyone. The third case is impossible to solve, as the second person needs to be a friend with everybody, but the first one is a complete stranger.'
