b'H. Palindromic Magictime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter learning some fancy algorithms about palindromes, Chouti found palindromes very interesting, so he wants to challenge you with this problem.Chouti has got two strings AA and BB. Since he likes palindromes, he would like to pick aa as some non-empty palindromic substring of AA and bb as some non-empty palindromic substring of BB. Concatenating them, he will get string abab.Chouti thinks strings he could get this way are interesting, so he wants to know how many different strings he can get.InputThe first line contains a single string AA (1?|A|?2?1051?|A|?2?105).The second line contains a single string BB (1?|B|?2?1051?|B|?2?105).Strings AA and BB contain only lowercase English letters.OutputThe first and only line should contain a single integer?? the number of possible strings.ExamplesInputCopyaaabaOutputCopy6InputCopyaabaabaaOutputCopy15NoteIn the first example, attainable strings are   "a" + "a" = "aa",  "aa" + "a" = "aaa",  "aa" + "aba" = "aaaba",  "aa" + "b" = "aab",  "a" + "aba" = "aaba",  "a" + "b" = "ab". In the second example, attainable strings are "aa", "aaa", "aaaa", "aaaba", "aab", "aaba", "ab", "abaa", "abaaa", "abaaba", "abab", "ba", "baa", "baba", "bb".Notice that though "a"+"aa"="aa"+"a"="aaa", "aaa" will only be counted once.'
