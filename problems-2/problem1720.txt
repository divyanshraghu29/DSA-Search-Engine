b'E. More Queries to Array...time limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou\'ve got an array, consisting of n integers: a1,?a2,?...,?an. Your task is to quickly run the queries of two types: Assign value x to all elements from l to r inclusive. After such query the values of the elements of array al,?al?+?1,?...,?ar become equal to x. Calculate and print sum , where k doesn\'t exceed 5. As the value of the sum can be rather large, you should print it modulo 1000000007?(109?+?7).InputThe first line contains two integers n and m (1???n,?m???105), showing, how many numbers are in the array and the number of queries, correspondingly. The second line contains n integers: a1,?a2,?...,?an (0???ai???109) ? the initial values of the array elements.Then m queries follow, one per line: The assign query has the following format: "", (1???l???r???n;?0???x???109). The query to calculate the sum has the following format: "", (1???l???r???n;?0???k???5).All numbers in the input are integers.OutputFor each query to calculate the sum print an integer ? the required sum modulo 1000000007?(109?+?7).ExamplesInputCopy4 55 10 2 1? 1 2 1= 2 2 0? 2 4 3= 1 4 1? 1 4 5OutputCopy25431300InputCopy3 11000000000 1000000000 1000000000? 1 3 0OutputCopy999999986'
