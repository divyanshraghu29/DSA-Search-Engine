b"E. XOR and Favorite Numbertime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBob has a favorite number k and ai of length n. Now he asks you to answer m queries. Each query is given by a pair li and ri and asks you to count the number of pairs of integers i and j, such that l???i???j???r and the xor of the numbers ai,?ai?+?1,?...,?aj is equal to k.InputThe first line of the input contains integers n, m and k (1???n,?m???100?000, 0???k???1?000?000)?? the length of the array, the number of queries and Bob's favorite number respectively.The second line contains n integers ai (0???ai???1?000?000)?? Bob's array.Then m lines follow. The i-th line contains integers li and ri (1???li???ri???n)?? the parameters of the i-th query.OutputPrint m lines, answer the queries in the order they appear in the input.

Not a single of these pairs is suitable for the second query.In the second sample xor equals 1 for all subarrays of an odd length."
