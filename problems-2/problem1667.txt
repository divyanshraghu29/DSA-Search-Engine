b'D. Pair of Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSimon has an array a1,?a2,?...,?an, consisting of n positive integers. Today Simon asked you to find a pair of integers l,?r (1???l???r???n), such that the following conditions hold:  there is integer j (l???j???r), such that all integers al,?al?+?1,?...,?ar are divisible by aj;  value r?-?l takes the maximum value among all pairs for which condition 1 is true; Help Simon, find the required pair of numbers (l,?r). If there are multiple required pairs find all of them.InputThe first line contains integer n (1???n???3?105).The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,?a2,?...,?an (1???ai???106).OutputPrint two integers in the first line ? the number of required pairs and the maximum value of r?-?l. On the following line print all l values from optimal pairs in increasing order.ExamplesInputCopy54 6 9 3 6OutputCopy1 32 InputCopy51 3 5 7 9OutputCopy1 41 InputCopy52 3 5 7 11OutputCopy5 01 2 3 4 5 NoteIn the first sample the pair of numbers is right, as numbers 6,?9,?3 are divisible by 3.In the second sample all numbers are divisible by number 1.In the third sample all numbers are prime, so conditions 1 and 2 are true only for pairs of numbers (1,?1), (2,?2), (3,?3), (4,?4), (5,?5).'
