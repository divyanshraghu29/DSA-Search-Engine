b'E. Vasya and Big Integerstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya owns three big integers ? a,l,ra,l,r. Let\'s define a partition of xx such a sequence of strings s1,s2,?,sks1,s2,?,sk that s1+s2+?+sk=xs1+s2+?+sk=x, where ++ is a concatanation of strings. sisi is the ii-th element of the partition. For example, number 1234512345 has the following partitions: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"], ["123", "4", "5"], ["1", "2345"], ["12345"] and lots of others.Let\'s call some partition of aa beautiful if each of its elements contains no leading zeros.Vasya want to know the number of beautiful partitions of number aa, which has each of sisi satisfy the condition l?si?rl?si?r. Note that the comparison is the integer comparison, not the string one.Help Vasya to count the amount of partitions of number aa such that they match all the given requirements. The result can be rather big, so print it modulo 998244353998244353.InputThe first line contains a single integer a?(1?a?101000000)a?(1?a?101000000).The second line contains a single integer l?(0?l?101000000)l?(0?l?101000000).The third line contains a single integer r?(0?r?101000000)r?(0?r?101000000).It is guaranteed that l?rl?r.It is also guaranteed that numbers a,l,ra,l,r contain no leading zeros.OutputPrint a single integer ? the amount of partitions of number aa such that they match all the given requirements modulo 998244353998244353.ExamplesInputCopy135115OutputCopy2InputCopy1000009OutputCopy1NoteIn the first test case, there are two good partitions 13+513+5 and 1+3+51+3+5.In the second test case, there is one good partition 1+0+0+0+01+0+0+0+0.'
