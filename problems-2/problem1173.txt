That can be performed only if there exists at least one such position jj that i?ji?j and ai=ajai=aj. The cost of this operation is bibi;  Choose some position ii and decrease aiai by 11. That can be performed only if there exists at least one such position jj that ai=aj+1ai=aj+1. The cost of this operation is ?bi?bi. Each operation can be performed arbitrary number of times (possibly zero).Let f(S)f(S) be minimum possible xx such that there exists a sequence of operations with total cost xx, after which all aiai from SS are pairwise distinct. Now for the task itself ...You are given a sequence PP consisting of nn pairs of integers (a1,b1),(a2,b2),?,(an,bn)(a1,b1),(a2,b2),?,(an,bn). All bibi are pairwise distinct. Let PiPi be the sequence consisting of the first ii pairs of PP. Your task is to calculate the values of f(P1),f(P2),?,f(Pn)f(P1),f(P2),?,f(Pn).InputThe first line contains a single integer nn (1?n?2?1051?n?2?105) ? the number of pairs in sequence PP.Next nn lines contain the elements of PP: ii-th of the next nn lines contains two integers aiai and bibi (1?ai?2?1051?ai?2?105, 1?bi?n1?bi?n). It is guaranteed that all values of bibi are pairwise distinct.OutputPrint nn integers ? the ii-th number should be equal to f(Pi)f(Pi).ExamplesInputCopy51 13 35 54 22 4OutputCopy000-5-16InputCopy42 42 32 21 1OutputCopy0371'
