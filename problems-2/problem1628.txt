The coordinates of each point are integers. Now he is wondering: how many squares are there with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with points painted in all its four vertexes? Help him, calculate this number.InputThe first line contains integer n (1???n???105). Each of the next n lines contains two integers xi,?yi (0???xi,?yi???105), the integers represent the coordinates of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that all the given points are distinct.OutputIn a single line print the required number of squares.ExamplesInputCopy50 00 22 02 21 1OutputCopy1InputCopy90 01 12 20 11 00 22 01 22 1OutputCopy5'
