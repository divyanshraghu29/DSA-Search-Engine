For security reasons, they want to choose several more or less random strings.Initially, they have a string ss consisting of lowercase English letters. Now they want to choose qq strings using the following steps, and you are to help them.  A string xx consisting of lowercase English letters and integers l and r (1?l?r?|s|) are chosen.  Consider all non-empty distinct substrings of the slsl+1?sr, that is all distinct strings sisi+1?sj where l?i?j?r. Among all of them choose all strings that are lexicographically greater than x.  If there are no such strings, you should print ?1. Otherwise print the lexicographically smallest among them. String a is lexicographically less than string b, if either a is a prefix of b and a?b, or there exists such a position i (1?i?min(|a|,|b|)), such that ai<bi and for all j (1?j<i) aj=bj. Here |a| denotes the length of the string a.InputThe first line of input contains a non-empty string s (1?|s|?105) consisting of lowercase English letters.The second line contains an integer q (1?q?2?105)?? the number of strings to select.Each of the next q lines contains two integers l, r (1?l?r?|s|) and a non-empty string x consisting of lowercase English letters. The total length of strings x for all queries does not exceed 2?105.OutputOutput q lines, each of them should contain the desired string or ?1, if there is no such string.ExamplesInputCopybaa51 2 ba2 3 a1 2 b2 3 aa1 3 bOutputCopy-1aaba-1baInputCopybacb41 2 ba2 3 ac1 3 ac3 4 cOutputCopy-1cbcbInputCopybba11 1 bOutputCopy-1NoteConsider the first example.The string s is "baa". The queries are as follows.  We consider the substring s1s2 that is "ba". It has substrings "b", "a" and "ba", since none of them is greater than the query string "ba", the answer is ?1. We consider substring "aa". Among its substrings only "aa" is greater than the query string "a". So the answer is "aa". We consider substring "ba". Out of "b", "a" and "ba" only "ba" is greater than the query string "b", so the answer is "ba". We consider substring "aa". No substring of "aa" is greater than the query string "aa" so the answer is ?1. We consider substring "baa" and it has (among others) substrings "ba", "baa" which are greater than the query string "b". Since "ba" is lexicographically smaller than "baa", the answer is "ba". '
