Concatenation with intersectiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya had three strings aa, b and s, which consist of lowercase English letters. The lengths of strings a and b are equal to n, the length of the string s is equal to m. Vasya decided to choose a substring of the string a, then choose a substring of the string b and concatenate them. Formally, he chooses a segment [l1,r1] (1?l1?r1?n) and a segment [l2,r2] (1?l2?r2?n), and after concatenation he obtains a string a[l1,r1]+b[l2,r2]=al1al1+1?ar1bl2bl2+1?br2.Now, Vasya is interested in counting number of ways to choose those segments adhering to the following conditions:  segments [l1,r1] and [l2,r2] have non-empty intersection, i.e. there exists at least one integer x, such that l1?x?r1 and l2?x?r2;  the string a[l1,r1]+b[l2,r2] is equal to the string s. InputThe first line contains integers n and m (1?n?500000,2?m?2?n)?? the length of strings a and b and the length of the string s.The next three lines contain strings a, b and s, respectively. The length of the strings a and b is n, while the length of the string s is m.All strings consist of lowercase English letters.OutputPrint one integer?? the number of ways to choose a pair of segments, which satisfy Vasya's conditions.ExamplesInputCopy6 5aabbaabaaaabaaaaaOutputCopy4InputCopy5 4azazazazazazazOutputCopy11InputCopy9 12abcabcabcxyzxyzxyzabcabcayzxyzOutputCopy2NoteLet's list all the pairs of segments that Vasya could choose in the first example:  [2,2] and [2,5];  [1,2] and [2,4];  [5,5] and [2,5];  [5,6] and [3,5]; "
