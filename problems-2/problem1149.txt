b'E. The Fair Nut and Rectanglestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe Fair Nut got stacked in planar world. He should solve this task to get out.You are given nn rectangles with vertexes in (0,0)(0,0), (xi,0)(xi,0), (xi,yi)(xi,yi), (0,yi)(0,yi). For each rectangle, you are also given a number aiai. Choose some of them that the area of union minus sum of aiai of the chosen ones is maximum.It is guaranteed that there are no nested rectangles.Nut has no idea how to find the answer, so he asked for your help.InputThe first line contains one integer nn (1?n?1061?n?106)?? the number of rectangles.Each of the next nn lines contains three integers xixi, yiyi and aiai (1?xi,yi?1091?xi,yi?109, 0?ai?xi?yi0?ai?xi?yi).It is guaranteed that there are no nested rectangles.OutputIn a single line print the answer to the problem?? the maximum value which you can achieve.ExamplesInputCopy3, 4 4 8, 1 5 0, 5 2 10, OutputCopy9InputCopy4, 6 2 4, 1 6 2, 2 4 3, 5 3 8, OutputCopy10NoteIn the first example, the right answer can be achieved by choosing the first and the second rectangles.In the second example, the right answer can also be achieved by choosing the first and the second rectangles.'
