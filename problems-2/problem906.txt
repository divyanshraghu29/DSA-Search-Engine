b'E. Strange Operationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKoa the Koala has a binary string ss of length n. Koa can perform no more than n?1 (possibly zero) operations of the following form:In one operation Koa selects positions i and i+1 for some i with 1?i<|s| and sets si to max(si,si+1). Then Koa deletes position i+1 from s (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated).Note that after every operation the length of s decreases by 1.How many different binary strings can Koa obtain by doing no more than n?1 (possibly zero) operations modulo 109+7 (1000000007)?InputThe only line of input contains binary string s (1?|s|?106). For all i (1?i?|s|) si=0 or si=1.OutputOn a single line print the answer to the problem modulo 109+7 (1000000007).ExamplesInputCopy000, OutputCopy3, InputCopy0101, OutputCopy6, InputCopy0001111, OutputCopy16, InputCopy00101100011100, OutputCopy477, NoteIn the first sample Koa can obtain binary strings: 0, 00 and 000.In the second sample Koa can obtain binary strings: 1, 01, 11, 011, 101 and 0101. For example:  to obtain 01 from 0101 Koa can operate as follows: 0101?0(10)1?011?0(11)?01.  to obtain 11 from 0101 Koa can operate as follows: 0101?(01)01?101?1(01)?11. Parentheses denote the two positions Koa selected in each operation.'
