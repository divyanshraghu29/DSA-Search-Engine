b"G. Two-Pathstime limit per test3.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a weighted tree (undirected connected graph with no cycles, loops or multiple edges) with nn vertices. The edge {uj,vj}{uj,vj} has weight wjwj. Also each vertex i has its own value ai assigned to it.Let's call a path starting in vertex u and ending in vertex v, where each edge can appear no more than twice (regardless of direction), a 2-path. Vertices can appear in the 2-path multiple times (even start and end vertices).For some 2-path p profit Pr(p)=?v?distinct vertices in?pav??e?distinct edges in?pke?we, where ke is the number of times edge e appears in p. That is, vertices are counted once, but edges are counted the number of times they appear in p.You are about to answer m queries. Each query is a pair of vertices (qu,qv). For each query find 2-path p from qu to qv with maximal profit Pr(p).InputThe first line contains two integers n and q (2?n?3?105, 1?q?4?105) ? the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries.The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,a2,?,an (1?ai?109) ? the values of the vertices.Next n?1 lines contain descriptions of edges: each line contains three space separated integers ui, vi and wi (1?ui,vi?n, ui?vi, 1?wi?109) ? there is edge {ui,vi} with weight wi in the tree.Next q lines contain queries (one per line). Each query contains two integers qui and qvi (1?qui,qvi?n) ? endpoints of the 2-path you need to find.OutputFor each query print one integer per line ? maximal profit Pr(p) of the some 2-path p with the corresponding endpoints.ExampleInputCopy7 66 5 5 3 2 1 21 2 22 3 22 4 14 5 16 4 27 3 251 14 45 66 43 43 7OutputCopy999812-14NoteExplanation of queries:   (1,1) ? one of the optimal 2-paths is the following: 1?2?4?5?4?2?3?2?1.
