b'G. Yet Another Partiton Problemtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given array a1,a2,?,ana1,a2,?,an. You need to split it into k subsegments (so every element is included in exactly one subsegment).The weight of a subsegment al,al+1,?,ar is equal to (r?l+1)?maxl?i?r(ai). The weight of a partition is a total weight of all its segments.Find the partition of minimal weight.InputThe first line contains two integers n and k (1?n?2?104, 1?k?min(100,n)) ? the length of the array a and the number of subsegments in the partition.The second line contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (1?ai?2?104) ? the array a.OutputPrint single integer ? the minimal weight among all possible partitions.ExamplesInputCopy4 2, 6 1 7 4, OutputCopy25, InputCopy4 3, 6 1 7 4, OutputCopy21, InputCopy5 4, 5 1 5 1 5, OutputCopy21, NoteThe optimal partition in the first example is next: 6 1 7 | 4.The optimal partition in the second example is next: 6 | 1 | 7 4.One of the optimal partitions in the third example is next: 5 | 1 5 | 1 | 5.'
