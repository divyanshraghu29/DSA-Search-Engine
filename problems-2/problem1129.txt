b'E2. Array and Segments (Hard version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe only difference between easy and hard versions is a number of elements in the array.You are given an array aa consisting of n integers. The value of the i-th element of the array is ai.You are also given a set of m segments. The j-th segment is [lj;rj], where 1?lj?rj?n.You can choose some subset of the given set of segments and decrease values on each of the chosen segments by one (independently). For example, if the initial array a=[0,0,0,0,0] and the given segments are [1;3] and [2;4] then you can choose both of them and the array will become b=[?1,?2,?2,?1,0].You have to choose some subset of the given segments (each segment can be chosen at most once) in such a way that if you apply this subset of segments to the array a and obtain the array b then the value nmaxi=1bi?nmini=1bi will be maximum possible.Note that you can choose the empty set.If there are multiple answers, you can print any.If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1?n?105,0?m?300) ? the length of the array a and the number of segments, respectively.The second line of the input contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (?106?ai?106), where ai is the value of the i-th element of the array a.The next m lines are contain two integers each. The j-th of them contains two integers lj and rj (1?lj?rj?n), where lj and rj are the ends of the j-th segment.OutputIn the first line of the output print one integer d ? the maximum possible value nmaxi=1bi?nmini=1bi if b is the array obtained by applying some subset of the given segments to the array a.In the second line of the output print one integer q (0?q?m) ? the number of segments you apply.In the third line print q distinct integers c1,c2,?,cq in any order (1?ck?m) ? indices of segments you apply to the array a in such a way that the value nmaxi=1bi?nmini=1bi of the obtained array b is maximum possible.If there are multiple answers, you can print any.ExamplesInputCopy5 4, 2 -2 3 1 2, 1 3, 4 5, 2 5, 1 3, OutputCopy6, 2, 4 1 , InputCopy5 4, 2 -2 3 1 4, 3 5, 3 4, 2 4, 2 5, OutputCopy7, 2, 3 2 , InputCopy1 0, 1000000, OutputCopy0, 0, , NoteIn the first example the obtained array b will be [0,?4,1,1,2] so the answer is 6.In the second example the obtained array b will be [2,?3,1,?1,4] so the answer is 7.In the third example you cannot do anything so the answer is 0.'
