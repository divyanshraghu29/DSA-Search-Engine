Given a string S of length n and q queries each query is on the format i j k which means sort the substring consisting of the characters from i to j in non-decreasing order if k?=?1 or in non-increasing order if k?=?0.Output the final string after applying the queries.InputThe first line will contain two integers n,?q (1???n???105, 0???q???50?000), the length of the string and the number of queries respectively. Next line contains a string S itself. It contains only lowercase English letters.Next q lines will contain three integers each i,?j,?k (1???i???j???n, ).OutputOutput one line, the string S after applying the queries.ExamplesInputCopy10 5abacdabcda7 10 05 8 11 4 03 6 07 10 1OutputCopycbcaaaabddInputCopy10 1agjucbvdfk1 10 1OutputCopyabcdfgjkuvNoteFirst sample test explanation:'
