b'A. Greg and Arraytime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGreg has an array a?=?a1,?a2,?...,?an and m operations. Each operation looks as: li, ri, di, (1???li???ri???n). To apply operation i to the array means to increase all array elements with numbers li,?li?+?1,?...,?ri by value di.Greg wrote down k queries on a piece of paper. Each query has the following form: xi, yi, (1???xi???yi???m). That means that one should apply operations with numbers xi,?xi?+?1,?...,?yi to the array.Now Greg is wondering, what the array a will be after all the queries are executed. Help Greg.InputThe first line contains integers n, m, k (1???n,?m,?k???105). The second line contains n integers: a1,?a2,?...,?an (0???ai???105) ? the initial array.Next m lines contain operations, the operation number i is written as three integers: li, ri, di, (1???li???ri???n), (0???di???105).Next k lines contain the queries, the query number i is written as two integers: xi, yi, (1???xi???yi???m).The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.OutputOn a single line print n integers a1,?a2,?...,?an ? the array after executing all the queries. Separate the printed numbers by spaces.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams of the %I64d specifier.ExamplesInputCopy3 3 31 2 31 2 11 3 22 3 41 21 32 3OutputCopy9 18 17InputCopy1 1 111 1 11 1OutputCopy2InputCopy4 3 61 2 3 41 2 12 3 23 4 41 21 32 31 21 32 3OutputCopy5 18 31 20'
