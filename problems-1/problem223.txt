He starts with a deck of NN cards (numbered 11 through N), where for each valid i, the i-th card has an integer Ai written on it. Then he starts dealing the cards one by one in the order from card 1 to card N. Chef wins if at some moment in time, the sum of all the cards dealt so far is between X and Y inclusive; if this never happens, Chef loses.\nWe want Chef to win the game, so without him noticing, we will swap some pairs of cards (possibly none) before the game starts. Find the smallest number of swaps we need so that Chef would win the game, or determine that it is impossible to make Chef win.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, X and Y.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest required number of swaps or \xe2\x88\x921 if Chef cannot win.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4103\nX\xe2\x89\xa4Y\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4103 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 104\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (22 points): Chef can win if we make up to 2 swaps\nSubtask #2 (34 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4400\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4400 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 4,000\n\nSubtask #3 (44 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 4 5\n1 2 3\n3 3 4\n1 2 3\n2 20 30\n40 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can swap the last card with one of the first two cards.\nExample case 2: No swaps are necessary, Chef wins after dealing the first two cards.\nExample case 3: The order of the cards in the deck does not matter, Chef cannot win.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85triplem5ds\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BLKJK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bit Manipulation, 0-1 Knapsack\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Knapsack\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2903\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
