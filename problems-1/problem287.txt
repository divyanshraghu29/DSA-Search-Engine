At any time, the pen may be placed above a point (x,y)(x,y) on the paper or touching it at a point (x,y)(x,y); in both cases, we call the point (x,y) the position of the pen. The initial position of the pen is (0,0).\nYou may perform the following types of actions:\n\nmove the pen down until it touches the paper\nlift the pen (if it was touching the paper); after this action, the pen is not touching the paper\nmove the pen from its current position (x,y) to (x\xe2\x88\x921,y) or (x+1,y)\nmove the pen from its current position (0,y) to (0,y+1)\n\nActions of the first two types take no time, an action of the third type takes 1 second and an action of the fourth type takes 1 second. Each action may be performed any number of times. You may only move the pen for at most P seconds in total.\nWhenever the pen is moved from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) while touching the paper, it draws a line segment between these points (inclusive). Drawing over a line segment repeatedly is allowed.\nYou are given N special line segments; each of them is parallel with the x-axis. A special line segment is fully drawn if each point belonging to it also belongs to some drawn line segment. Your goal is to fully draw as many special line segments as possible in P seconds. How many can you fully draw?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and P.\nEach of the next N lines contains three space-separated integers y, s and e denoting a special line segment between points (s,y) and (e,y) (including these points).\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of special segments you can fully draw.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa415\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa4e\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nthe special line segments do not touch or intersect\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (90 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1 2\n0 1 2\n3 13\n1 1 2\n3 1 3\n1 3 4\n3 14\n1 1 2\n3 1 3\n1 3 4\n4 10\n1 3 4\n1 1 2\n2 1 2\n2 3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85arpa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DLINE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2526\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-12-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
