b"\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nLet's call an integer sequence nice if the sum of its elements is divisible by a given integer K. You are given an integer sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. Hasan wanted to find the number of nice subsequences of this sequence. However, this problem is too easy, so Hasan decided to add an extra constraint. \nFor an arbitrary non-empty sequence of indices i_1 \\lt i_2 \\lt \\ldots \\lt i_L, let's call a subsequence A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, \\ldots, A_{i_L} very nice if it is nice and i_L-i_1 \\ge W. Help Hasan and find the number of very nice subsequences. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo 10^9+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and W.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of very nice subsequences modulo 10^9+7.\nConstraints\n\n1 \\le T \\le 1,000\n1 \\le N \\le 10^5\n2 \\le K \\le 50\n0 \\le W \\le N-1\n0 \\le A_i \\le K-1 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3 \\cdot 10^5\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6 3 3\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85deadwing97\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CSUBSQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Modular Arithmetic, Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Recursion\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2804\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-12-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
