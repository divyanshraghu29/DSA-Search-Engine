The subsequence may even start with trailing zeros. For example 10, 01 are subsequences of 101 while 110 is NOT a subsequence of 101. Note that there are 8 subsequences of 101. The subsequence 1 appears twice and should be counted as different while computing the sum.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer n.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the sum of digits of all subsequences of f[n], modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n8\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Since f[1]=1, we have only two subsequences, "" (empty subsequence) and "1". So the sum of digits of both subsequences is 0+1=1.\nTest case 2: Since f[2]=10, we have four subsequences, "" (empty subsequence), "1", "0" and "10". So the sum of digits of all the subsequences is 0+1+0+1=2.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nutkarsh_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FIBOSEQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Fermat\'s Little Theorem\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Modular Arithmetic\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2508\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-08-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
