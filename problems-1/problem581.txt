You are given q queries. In the i-th query, you are given two indices l and r such that 1?l?r?n. Let s=a[l,r]. You are allowed to do the following operation on s:  Choose two indices x and y such that 1?x?y?|s|. Let t be the substring t=s[x,y]. Then for all 1?i?|t|?1, the condition ti?ti+1 has to hold. Note that x=y is always a valid substring.  Delete the substring s[x,y] from s. For each of the q queries, find the minimum number of operations needed to make s an empty string.Note that for a string s, s[l,r] denotes the subsegment sl,sl+1,?,sr.InputThe first line contains two integers n and q (1?n,q?2?105) ?? the length of the binary string a and the number of queries respectively.The second line contains a binary string a of length n (ai?{0,1}).Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1?l?r?n) ?? representing the substring of each query.OutputPrint q lines, the i-th line representing the minimum number of operations needed for the i-th query.ExamplesInputCopy5 3, 11011, 2 4, 1 5, 3 5, OutputCopy1, 3, 2, InputCopy10 3, 1001110110, 1 10, 2 5, 5 10, OutputCopy4, 2, 3, NoteIn the first test case,   The substring is 101, so we can do one operation to make the substring empty.  The substring is 11011, so we can do one operation on s[2,4] to make 11, then use two more operations to make the substring empty.  The substring is 011, so we can do one operation on s[1,2] to make 1, then use one more operation to make the substring empty. '
