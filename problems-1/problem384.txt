b"\n\nChef is writing some arbitrary strings as he is getting bored. After writing some strings , he thinks that his arrangement of letters is very dirty. Then he is struck by an idea that he can play a game with those arbitrary strings .\nNOTE:NOTE:\nStrings are in form aabbbccdeefffff\xe2\x80\xa6.. and so on. once the repetition of a letter is over , it can't be repeated again . ( abbcddddeefff (valid) ,    aabbbccbdd  ( invalid, as b is repeated again even after its repetition is over))\nHe takes a string S and then decides to modify the string such that it should contain all the letters present in it in ascending order of their repetitions. To do that he starts swapping the groups of letters . ( swaps whole \xe2\x80\xb2aa\xe2\x80\xb2 with \xe2\x80\xb2ccc\xe2\x80\xb2 , swaps whole \xe2\x80\xb2ddd\xe2\x80\xb2 with \xe2\x80\xb2ffff\xe2\x80\xb2 , etc) and cost of swap is difference in the frequencies of the letters getting swapped . Frequency of a letter is the number of times the letter is repeated in the string.\nNOTE :  During a swap you have to swap all the repetitions of the selected letter with the other. suppose string is aabbbcccdd , if you want to swap a and c swapping occurs like \xe2\x80\xb2aa\xe2\x80\xb2 with \xe2\x80\xb2ccc\xe2\x80\xb2 , thus after swap , string is cccbbbaadd .\nFind the minimum cost to attain such a string .\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, the string S. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output a single line which gives minimum cost to attain the desired string.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa4105 \n\nSubtasks\n\n30 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa4100\n70 points : Original Constraints\n\nSample Input:\n    4\n    aabbcccdeffffggghhhhhii\n    aaaa\n    abbcccdd\n    aaaabbbccd\n\nSample Output:\n    5\n    0\n    1\n    4\n\nEXPLANATION:\nCase\xe2\x88\x921 :  First swap 'd' with 'aa'( 2-1=1) and 'e' with 'bb' (2-1=1 ) , then swap 'ii' with 'ccc'( 3-2=1) , then 'ccc' with 'ffff' ( 4-3=1  )  , then 'ffff' with 'hhhhh' ( 5-4=1 ) . Thus total cost will  be 1+1+1+1+1 =5 and the final string would be deiiaabbcccgggffffhhhhh .\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85mann2108\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHFSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy-medium, mann2108, observation, sorting\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
