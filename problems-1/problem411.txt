b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian  and Vietnamese as well.\nNazik gave Batman a tree with N vertices (numbered 1 through N). There are some robbers in the tree; of course, Batman wants to catch the robbers.\nInitially, Batman is in a vertex s and his power is equal to p. During each of the next M seconds, the following process happens:\n\nA robber with power r runs from a vertex x straight to vertex y.\nBatman either catches the robber or stays in his current vertex (and never catches this robber).\nBatman can only catch the robber if Batman's power is strictly greater than the robber's power.\nLet's denote Batman's current vertex by s (s=si initially). To catch the robber, Batman must choose a vertex g such that each vertex on the simple path between x and y (inclusive) lies also on the simple path between s and g (inclusive). If it is impossible to choose a vertex g so that this condition is satisfied, Batman cannot catch this robber.\nIf Batman catches the robber, g becomes his current vertex.\nAfter Batman catches this robber, his power increases by t.\n\nYour task is to calculate the maximum power Batman can have after M seconds if he chooses the robbers to catch optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, si and p.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting an edge in the tree between vertices u and v.\nThe next line contains a single integer M.\nEach of the following M lines contains four integers x, y, r and t describing a robber.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible value of Batman's power after M seconds.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4si,u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\nx\xe2\x89\xa0y\n1\xe2\x89\xa4p,r\xe2\x89\xa4109\n|t|\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 4\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of M for all test cases does not exceed 4\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6 1 4\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n4 5\n1 6\n5\n6 4 3 8\n1 2 3 2\n4 6 5 -1\n6 5 4 6\n5 4 5 -3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nIn the 2-nd second, Batman will go from vertex s=1 to vertex g=5.\nIn the 4-th second, Batman will go from vertex s=5 to vertex g=6.\nBatman should ignore robbers moving in the 1-st, 3-rd and 5-th second.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85barenuz\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BTMNTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Lazy Propagation, DP on Trees, Euler Tour\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Segment Trees, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2973\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-06-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
