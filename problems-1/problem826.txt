b'E. Distinctive Roots in a Treetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree with nn vertices. Each vertex ii has a value aiai associated with it.Let us root the tree at some vertex v. The vertex v is called a distinctive root if the following holds: in all paths that start at v and end at some other node, all the values encountered are distinct. Two different paths may have values in common but a single path must have all distinct values.Find the number of distinctive roots in the tree.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1?n?2?105) ? the number of vertices in the tree.The next line contains n space-separated integers a1,a2,?,an (1?ai?109).The following n?1 lines each contain two space-separated integers u and v (1?u, v?n), denoting an edge from u to v.It is guaranteed that the edges form a tree.OutputPrint a single integer ? the number of distinctive roots in the tree.ExamplesInputCopy5, 2 5 1 1 4, 1 2, 1 3, 2 4, 2 5, OutputCopy3InputCopy5, 2 1 1 1 4, 1 2, 1 3, 2 4, 2 5, OutputCopy0NoteIn the first example, 1, 2 and 5 are distinctive roots.'
