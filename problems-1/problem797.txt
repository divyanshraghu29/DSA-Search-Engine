Painting Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given nn integers, each integer is from 11 to nn, all of them are pairwise distinct. You have to paint them red and blue (each integer should have exactly one color).The cost of painting is the number of pairs (x,y) such that ymodx=0, y is red and x is blue.For each k?[1,n], calculate the maximum cost of painting if exactly k integers should have a red color.InputThe first line contains one integer n (2?n?105).OutputFor each k?[1,n] print one integer ? the maximum cost of painting, if exactly k integers should be red.ExamplesInputCopy6, OutputCopy3 5 6 6 5 0, InputCopy2, OutputCopy1 0, InputCopy11, OutputCopy3 6 9 11 12 13 14 14 13 10 0, '
