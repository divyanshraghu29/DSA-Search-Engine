A well known legend says that in the middle of each road, there is a hidden precious stone. There are K different colours of stones, conveniently numbered 1 through K, and for each road, we also know the colour of the stone hidden there.\nKing Chef wants a new beautiful crown, so he organises an expedition to find some stones in the following way:\n\nChef chooses a set of M villages to be the expedition basis, in such a way that they form a connected subgraph of Chefland, i.e. for any two villages in the basis, the path between them must not visit any village that is not in the basis.\nThe expedition gathers the stones in all roads which lie on the "frontier" of the expedition basis, i.e. all edges for which one endpoint lies in the basis and the other endpoint does not.\n\nFor each of the 2K possible sets of colours, Chef wants to know if it is possible that the expedition will return with exactly this set, i.e. there is a basis such that the expedition returns with at least one stone of each colour in this set and no stones with colours that are not in this set.\nSince Chef is not sure about the size of the expedition crew, he also wants you to find these answers for each possible value of M.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nEach of the following N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains three space-separated integers u, v and c, denoting that villages u and v are connected by a road and in this road, there is a stone with colour c.\n\nOutput\nLet\'s associate a set S of colours with a bitmask \xe2\x88\x91c\xe2\x88\x88S2c\xe2\x88\x921.\nFor each test case, print N lines. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines should contain 2K integers but not separated by spaces; for each j (0\xe2\x89\xa4j<2K), the j+1-th integer should be 1 if it is possible to obtain the set with bitmask j for M=i or 0 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa412\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4K\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 500\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): for each valid i, the i-th edge connects vertices i and i+1 (in other words, the tree is a line)\nSubtask #2 (15 points): K\xe2\x89\xa44\nSubtask #3 (25 points): K\xe2\x89\xa48\nSubtask #4 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 2\n1 2 1\n2 3 2\n3 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0111\n0110\n1000\n01\n01\n10\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\nFor M=1, there are three subtrees:\n\nonly vertex 1: we obtain the set {1} with bitmask 1\nonly vertex 2: we obtain the set {1,2} with bitmask 3\nonly vertex 3: we obtain the set {2} with bitmask 2\n\nFor M=2, there are two possible subtrees:\n\nvertices {1,2}: we obtain the set {2} with bitmask 2\nvertices {2,3}: we obtain the set {1} with bitmask 1\n\nFor M=3, we can only choose the whole tree, which generates the empty set (with bitmask 0).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\narthurfn\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PSTONES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 arthurfn, arthurfn, aug20, daniel_1999, dp-on-trees, dynamic-programming, hard, rishup_nitdgp, walsh-hadamard\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2775\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-07-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
