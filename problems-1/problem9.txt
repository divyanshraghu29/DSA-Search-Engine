b'\nA thermal decomposition reaction is breakdown of a compound into one or more compounds when heated.\nFor example, P\xe2\x86\x92a\xe2\x8b\x85Q+b\xe2\x8b\x85R is a decomposition reaction. Here, 1 unit of P is converted into a unit of Q and b unit of R after completion of the reaction.\nYou are given N compounds numbered from 1 to N. The initial amount of the i^{th} compound is Q_i. \nYou are also given M equations. Every equation is of the form: \nC_0 \\rightarrow W_1\\cdot C_1 + W_2\\cdot C_2 + \\ldots + W_X\\cdot C_X.\nHere:\n\nC_0 represents the compound which will decompose into X compounds on heating.\nC_i (1 \\leq i \\leq X ) represents the compounds into which C_0 is decomposed.\nW_i (1 \\leq i \\leq X ) represents the number of units of C_i produced due to the decomposition of C_0.\nC_i > C_{i-1} for all (1 \\leq i \\leq X).\n\nNote that a compound can decompose in at most one way only.\nFind the final amount of each compound after prolonged heating. Since the number can be huge, print the answer modulo 10^9+7.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain two space separated integers N and M - the number of compounds and the number of equations.\nSecond line will contain N space separated integers Q_1, Q_2, ..., Q_N - the initial amounts of each compound.\nThe next 2\\cdot M lines contain the details of the M equations.  Each equation is represented using 2 lines.\nFirst line of the i^{th} equation contains two space separated integers C_{i,0}, X_i - the decomposing compound and the number of compounds in which it decomposes.\nSecond line of the i^{th} equation contains 2 \\cdot X_i space separated integers W_{i,1}, C_{i,1}, W_{i,2}, C_{i,2},\xe2\x80\xa6 ,W_{i,X_i}, C_{i,X_i} - the number of units and the types of compounds into which C_{i,0} decomposes. \n\nOutput Format\nPrint N lines. The i^{th} line contains a single integer denoting the final amount of the i^{th} compound after prolonged heating modulo 10^9+7.\nConstraints\n\n0 \\leq M \\lt N \\leq 10^5\n0 \\leq Q_i \\lt (10^9+7)\n1 \\leq C_{i,0} \\lt N\n1 \\leq X_i \\leq (N - C_{i,0})\n1 \\leq W_{i,j} \\lt (10^9+7), \\forall (1 \\leq j \\leq X_i) and (1 \\leq i \\leq M).\nC_{i, j} < C_{i,j+1}, \\forall (0 \\leq j < X_i) and (1 \\leq i \\leq M).\nC_{i, 0} \\lt C_{i + 1, 0}, \\forall (1 \\leq i < M) \nSum of X_i over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 2\n5 10 12 2\n1 2\n3 2 4 3\n3 1\n2 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n25\n0\n66\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Cse 1: We have 4 compounds initially. For better explanation, we refer the compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 as A_1, A_2, A_3, and A_4 respectively. Initially, the amount of A_1, A_2, A_3, and A_4 present is 5, 10, 12, and 2 respectively.\nThe two equations are:\n\nA_1 \\rightarrow 3 \\cdot A_2 + 4 \\cdot A_3\nA_3 \\rightarrow 2 \\cdot A_4\n\nWe know that 1 unit of A_1 produces 3 units of A_2 and 4 units of A_3. Thus, the initial 5 units of A_1 decompose to 5\\cdot 3 = 15 units of A_2 and 5\\cdot 4 = 20 units of A_3. Note that now there are 0 units of A_1 left.\nConsidering only this reaction, the updated amounts of chemicals would be [0, 10 + 15, 12 + 20, 2] = [0, 25, 32, 2].\nWe also know that 1 unit of A_3 decomposes to 2 units of A_4. The total amount of A_3 available for decomposition would be 32 units (12 units were available initially and 20 units were formed due to decomposition). Thus these 32 units would produce 32\\cdot 2 = 64 units of A_4.\nThus, after prolonged heating, the amounts of compounds are [0, 25, 0, 64+2] = [0, 25, 0, 66].\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ultimate_zero\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DCP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 array, dynamic-programming, easy, start29, ultimate_zero\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1632\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-02-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
