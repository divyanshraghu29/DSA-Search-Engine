b'\nChef wanted to reach another milestone in his journey. So Chef decided to meet up with Unacademy. Chef was sure Unacademy will support him for eternity. But as tradition goes Unac from  Unacademy presented the following welcome task for Chef to solve.  \nUnac gave Chef a magical sequence of N numbers [m1,m2,m3,......mN]. The given sequence is magical because sum of this sequence is at most 300. Chef has to choose a special sequence of numbers [a1,a2,a3,a4,.......aN]. Each element of this special sequence must belong to the set \\{-1,0,1\\}.\nUnac gave Chef two more numbers S and K. Chef has to find total no. of solutions of the following equation modulo 10^9+7.\na_1*m_1+a_2*m_2+a_3*m_3+.............+a_N*m_N = S.\nThere can be  atmost  K numbers in special sequence with value  "-1". \nRight now Chef is busy with home shifting. So he asked you to find total number of solutions of the equation given by Unac modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains three lines of input.\nFirst line contains a single integer N.\nSecond line contains N space separated integers  m_1,m_2,m_3,......m_N\nThird line contains two space separated integers S , K. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line  No of solutions of equation modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1 \\leq T \\leq 10\n1 \\leq N \\leq 100 \n0 \\leq  m_i  \\leq  300 \n0 \\leq S \\leq 10^9 \n0 \\leq K \\leq 10^9\nSum of all values of m_i in a single testcase does not exceed 300.\n\nSample Input:\n1\n2 \n1 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n0 2\n\nSample Output:\n3\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis list is : [1,1]\nPossible solutions are [1,-1]  , [-1,1] , [0,0] \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85avenger786\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COCR103\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 avenger786, cros2020, dynamic-programming, easy-medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
