b"\nConsider an array $A$ of size $N$ which only contains $1s$ and $0s$. Let's define 'Group' as the subarray containing only 0s or only 1s. You are also given two values $x$ and $y$. Your task is to flip the values (from $0$ to $1$ or from $1$ to $0$) in the array such that length of every 'Group' is between $x$ and $y$ (inclusive). But thats not it :p. You are also given another array $B$ of size $N$ which consists of the cost of flipping the respective values of array A. Formally, for each position $i$ from $1$ to $N$ ,the cost of flipping the value of $Ai$ is $Bi$. You need to find the minimum cost such that the resultant array $A'$ satisfy the given condition. \nNote: It is possible that answer does not exist. In that case print -1.\n\n\nInput\nFirst line contains $T$ denoting number of test cases.Next line consists of $N$ denoting the size of the arrays. Next line contains $x$ and $y$ as described in the problem.Following line consists of $N$ space separated integers of array $A$ where elements can be $0$ or $1$. Next line consists of $N$ space separated integers of array $B$, cost of flipping the values at $ith$ position.\nOutput\nIf answer exists, print overall minimum cost else print -1 (in new line).\nConstraints\n\n$1$ <= $T$ <= $70$\n$1$ <= $N$ <= $1000$\n$1$ <= $x$ <= $y$ <= $N$\n$Ai$ can be $0$ or $1$\n$0$ <= $Bi$ <= $1000$\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n\n$1$ <= $N$ <= $15$\nSubtask #2 (85 points):\n\n$1$ <= $N$ <= $1000$\nExample\nInput:\n1\n5\n2 3\n0 1 0 1 0\n10 5 11 4 1\n\nOutput:\n6\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.
