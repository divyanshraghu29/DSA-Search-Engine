b'\nChef is again playing a game with his best friend Garry. As usual, the rules of this game are extremely strange and uncommon.\nFirst, they are given a stack of $N$ discs. Each disc has a distinct, non-negative integer written on it. The players exchange turns to make a move. Before the start of the game, they both agree upon a set of positive integers  $S$ of size $K$. It is guaranteed that S contains the integer $1$. In a move, a player can select any value $x$ from $S$ and pop exactly $x$ elements from the top of the stack. The game ends when there are no discs remaining. Chef goes first.\nScoring: For every disc a player pops, his score increases by $2^p$ where $p$ is the integer written on the disc. For example, if a player pops the discs, with integers $p_1, p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_m$ written on it, during the entire course of the game, then his total score will be $2^{p_1} + 2^{p_2} + 2^{p_3} + \\dots + 2^{p_m}$.\nThe player with higher score wins the game. Determine the winner if both the players play optimally, or if the game ends in a draw.\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains $T$, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers $N$ and $K$, denoting the size of the stack and the set S respectively.\nNext line contains $N$ space separated integers $A_i$ where $A_1$ is the topmost element, denoting the initial arrangement of the stack.\nThe last line of each test case contains $K$ space separated integers each denoting $x_i$.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output "Chef" (without quotes) if Chef wins, "Garry" (without quotes) if Garry wins, otherwise "Draw" (without quotes) in a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n$1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n$1 \\leq K \\leq \\min(100, N)$\n$0 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$\n$1 \\leq x_i \\leq N$\n$x_i \\neq x_j$ for all $i \\neq j$\n$A_i \\neq A_j$ for all $i \\neq j$\nSet $S$ contains integer $1$. \nSum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\nSample Input:\n1\n3 2\n5 7 1\n1 2\n\nSample Output:\nChef\n\nExplanation:\nChef can select 2 from the set and draw the top two discs (with integers 5 and 7 written on it) from the stack. Garry cannot select 2 from the set as there is only 1 disc left in the stack. However, he can select 1 from the set and pop the last disc.\nSo, Chef\'s score = $2^5$ + $2^7$ = $160$\nGarry\'s score = $2^1$ = $2$\nChef wins.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85sarthakmanna\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Game Theory, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2396\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
