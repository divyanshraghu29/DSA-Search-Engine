b"\nThere is a country which has n houses and m bi-directional roads between these houses, where the ith road connects house ui to vi. A subset of these houses S is called a city if any house in S is reachable from any other house in S. Formally, a subset of houses S is a city if x and y are reachable from each other for all x,y\xe2\x88\x88S. The funding required for a city S consisting of k houses is defined as k2.\nThe president has given the mayor Saarang an order: divide the country into 2 cities with exactly one road connecting them. In other words, divide the country into two cities S1 and S2 such that:\n\nEach house i either belongs to S1 or S2.\nThere exists a single road connect a house x from S1 and a house y from S2.\n\nFor this purpose, you are allowed to build more bi-directional roads. The funding required to build a road between any 2 houses is c.\nSaarang, however, is busy preparing for his board exams so he requests you to solve this problem for him. Find the minimum total funding required to divide the country per the president's requirements, or \xe2\x88\x921 if no division is possible.\nNote: The total funding is the sum of the funding required for the 2 cities and the roads built. If after the division, the two cities have x and n\xe2\x88\x92x houses respectively and you have built a total of a roads, The total funding will be x2+(n\xe2\x88\x92x)2+c\xc3\x97a.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case consists of three integers n, m and c.\nm lines follow, each consisting of 2 integers ui and vi indicating a road between houses ui and vi.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the minimum funding required to divide the country per the president's requirements, or \xe2\x88\x921 if no division is possible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n and ui\xe2\x89\xa0vi\n2\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\x91n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\x91m\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\nThere is atmost one road between any x and y.\n\nSubtasks\nThe input is divided into multiple subtasks.
