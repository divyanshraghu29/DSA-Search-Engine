b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.\nYour friend works as a valet where N cars show up in a shift. The i-th car will arrive Ti seconds after the current moment, and the car can wait for at most Yi seconds. That is, your friend can only start parking the car from time Ti to Ti+Yi (inclusive).\nAdditionally, it takes Xi time to park the i-th car, which means he cannot park any other cars for Xi seconds starting from the time he starts parking the i-th car. It is known that no driver would like to wait for more time than it takes to park his car, so that Yi<Xi for all i. The driver of the i-th car will pay Ai coins as a tip to your friend if his car is parked. Note that he can start parking the next car immediately after he finishes parking the previous car.\nYour friend has asked you what will be the maximize possible earnings if he optimally chooses which cars to park and at what times.\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains one single integer N (1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x88\x92 the number of cars.\nThe second line contains N integers T1,T2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Tn \xe2\x88\x92 the time (in seconds) at which i-th car arrives.\nThe third line contains N integers X1,X2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Xn \xe2\x88\x92 the time (in seconds) required to park the i-th car.\nThe fourth line contains N integers Y1,Y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Yn \xe2\x88\x92 the maximum time (in seconds) for which the i-th car can wait.\nThe fifth line contains N integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,An \xe2\x88\x92 the tip which the i-th car driver gives after the car is parked.\n\nOutput:\nPrint a single integer \xe2\x88\x92 the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ti\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85103\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Yi<Xi\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5 8 11\n3 10 4\n1 0 1\n11 13 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\nExplanation\nIt is optimal to start parking the first car at 5 seconds. We finish parking at 8 seconds, and immediately start parking the second car.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85yash_daga\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/VALET\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Priority Queue, Multiset, Dynamic Programming, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Queues, Sets, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2397\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-04-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
