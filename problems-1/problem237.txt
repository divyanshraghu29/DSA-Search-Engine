b'\nYou are given a tree consisting of NN nodes. The nodes are numbered from 11 to N. The tree is rooted at the node 1. \nA tree is a connected undirected graph with N\xe2\x88\x921 edges.\nFind the sum of the distance between nodes x and y over all tuples (u,v,x,y) satisfying the following conditions:\n1) u<v\n2) u is the ancestor of node x and v is the ancestor of node y.\n3) Neither of u or v is the ancestor of the other.\nSince the sum can be enormous, print it modulo (109+7).\nNote:\n\nThe distance between two nodes of a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between these two nodes.\nNode x is considered to be the ancestor of y if x lies on the path from 1 to y.\nUsually, there is no bound on the stack memory and is equal to the total memory limit of 1.5 GB. But due to a system configuration issue, the stack limit for C++ is temporarily set to 8 MB. So, if you believe that your code requires a larger stack limit, please include this in your code.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test contains an integer N, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.\nN\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow. The ith of these lines contains two space-separated integers ui and vi, denoting an edge between the nodes ui and vi.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the sum obtained modulo (109+7).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N\nIt is guaranteed that the given nodes and edges construct a tree.\nThe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n3\n1 2\n1 3\n5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n2 5\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n2 5\n2 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n2\n8\n54\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: There is no such tuple satisfying the constraints.\nTest case 2: (2,3,2,3) is the only valid tuple and distance between node 2 and node 3 is 2.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85satyam_343\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREEDIST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, DP on Trees, Dynamic Programming, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3185\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-08-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
