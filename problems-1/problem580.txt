For all j such that 1?j?|p| and pi<pj, update pj to pj?1.  Delete the i-th element from p. Formally, update p to [p1,?,pi?1,pi+1,?,pn]. It can be shown that no matter what i you have chosen, p will be a permutation of integers from 1 to |p| after all operations.You want to be able to transform p into the empty permutation. Find the minimum strength s that will allow you to do so.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer n (1?n?5?105) ?? the length of the permutation p.The second line of input conatains n integers p1,p2,?,pn (1?pi?n) ?? the elements of the permutation p.It is guaranteed that all elements in p are distinct.OutputPrint the minimum strength s required.ExamplesInputCopy3, 3 2 1, OutputCopy1, InputCopy1, 1, OutputCopy0, InputCopy10, 1 8 4 3 7 10 6 5 9 2, OutputCopy1, NoteIn the first test case, the minimum s required is 1.Here is how we can transform p into the empty permutation with s=1:   In the first move, you can only choose i=2 as choosing any other value of i will result in |i?pi|?s being false. With i=2, p will be changed to [2,1].  In the second move, you choose i=1, then p will be changed to [1].  In the third move, you choose i=1, then p will be changed to [?]. It can be shown that with s=0, it is impossible to transform p into the empty permutation.'
