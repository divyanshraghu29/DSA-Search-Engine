b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nYou should choose an arbitrary (possibly empty) subsequence of A and multiply each element of this subsequence by \xe2\x88\x921. The resulting sequence should satisfy the following condition: the sum of elements of any contiguous subsequence with length greater than 1 is strictly positive.\nYou should minimise the sum of elements of the resulting sequence. Find one such sequence with the minimum possible sum.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN. For each valid i, Bi must be equal to either Ai (the sign of this element did not change) or \xe2\x88\x92Ai (the sign of this element changed).\nIf there is more than one answer, you may output any one.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nN\xe2\x89\xa42,000\n\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n4\n4 3 1 2\n6\n1 2 2 1 3 1\n5\n10 1 2 10 5\n4\n1 2 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 3 -1 2\n-1 2 2 -1 3 -1\n10 -1 2 10 -5\n1 2 -1 2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: If we change only the sign of A3, we get a sequence {4,3,\xe2\x88\x921,2} with sum 8. This sequence is valid because the sums of all its contiguous subsequences with length >1 are positive. (For example, the sum of elements of the contiguous subsequence {A3,A4} equals \xe2\x88\x921+2=1>0.)\nThere are only two valid sequences {4,3,\xe2\x88\x921,2} and {4,3,1,2} with sums 8 and 10 respectively, so this sequence has the smallest possible sum.\nFor instance, the sequence {4,\xe2\x88\x923,1,2} isn't valid, because the sum of {A2,A3,A4} equals \xe2\x88\x923+1+2=0\xe2\x89\xa40.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85isaf27\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHSIGN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2107\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-03-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
