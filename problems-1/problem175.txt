b'\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a tree with N nodes rooted at node 1, and your task is to color each node of the tree either white or black. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), let wi be the number of white nodes that occurs in a simple path from the root node to ith node and bi be the number of black nodes that occurs in a simple path from the root node to ith node. The cost of a node i is defined as the absolute difference between wi and bi. \nThe cost of the tree is defined as the summation of the cost of all the nodes in the tree. The value of the tree is defined as the absolute difference between the total number of white nodes and the total number of black nodes in the tree. You have to color the tree in such a way that the cost of the tree is minimized.\nYour task is to answer a single query Q, such that:\n\nIf Q=1, Determine the maximum value the tree can have after minimizing the cost of the tree.\nIf Q=2, Determine the minimum value the tree can have after minimizing the cost of the tree.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow:\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of nodes in the tree and the query to answer respectively.\nThe next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain two space-separated integers u and v, denoting that there is an edge between the node u and the node v.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the answer to the query. \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa42\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n,u\xe2\x89\xa0v\n\xe2\x88\x91N over all test cases does not exceed 105.\nIt is guaranteed that the given nodes and edges form a tree.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nQ=1\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points):\n\nOriginal constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n5 2\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Color the node 1 with black color and color the nodes 2,3,4,5 with white color to get the minimum cost of the tree, that is 3, and the maximum value of the tree, that is 3.\nTest case 2: Color the nodes 1,4 with black color and color the nodes 2,3,5 with white color to get the minimum cost of the tree, that is 3, and the minimum value of the tree, that is 1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85mexomerf\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREUPS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy-medium, ltime101, mexomerf, trees\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2613\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-10-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
