b'\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a tree GG with N nodes (numbered 1 through N) and N\xe2\x88\x921 undirected edges. For each node u in the tree, he can assign directions to the edges in such a way that u is reachable from all the other nodes. Let Cu be the number of valid topological orderings in the resulting directed acyclic graph.\nThis way, Chef obtains N pairs (C1,1),(C2,2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(CN,N) and he sorts all these pairs (Ci,i) in descending order (first by Ci and in the case of a tie by i). \nFor example, consider the tree below:\n\nThe sorted list of pairs is ((2,2),(1,3),(1,1)).\nChef quizzes you on this list \xe2\x80\x95 he wants you to find the K-th pair in the sorted list. To make that task easier, Chef only asks for K=1 (the largest pair) or K=2 (the second largest pair). Since the number of topological orderings can be very large, compute it modulo 109+7. \nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v, denoting that nodes u and v are connected by an edge.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers u and Cu modulo 109+7, where (Cu,u) is the K-th pair in the sorted list.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa42\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (30 points): K=1\nSubtask #3 (60 points): K=2\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 2\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The tree is\n\n\nFor u=1, there are C1=2 possible topological orderings: (3,4,2,1) and (4,3,2,1)\nFor u=2, there are C2=6 possible topological orderings: (3,4,1,2), (4,3,1,2), (3,1,4,2), (4,1,3,2), (1,3,4,2) and (1,4,3,2).\nFor u=3, there are C3=2 possible topological orderings: (1,4,2,3) and (4,1,2,3).\nFor u=4, there are C4=2 possible topological orderings: (3,1,2,4) and (1,3,2,4).\n\nThe sorted list of pairs is ((6,2),(2,4),(2,3),(2,1)).
