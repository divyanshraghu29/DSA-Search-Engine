b'\nProblem Statement\nYour hunter friend Sova has a crush on Reyna. Reyna has finally decided to go for a date with Sova ( In a hypothetical world of course ). Sova being a highly desperate fellow wants to reach her as soon as possible and keep her from waiting as Reyna is a short tempered person.\nSova has lost his recon bow that locates people and is unable to find out the path to reach Reyna. Sova needs your help in finding a path to reach his love Reyna.\nSova\xe2\x80\x99s city (icebox) can be represented as a N * M  grid consisting of N rows and M columns. You are given one starting point  V ( Sova\xe2\x80\x99s current location in icebox), one ending point  S  (Reyna\xe2\x80\x99s location in icebox) and the rest of the points as either P or O.  P denotes an obstacle meaning you cannot pass through it while O denotes a valid cell you can pass through.\nYou can move in any of the four directions i.e. if you are at point (i,j) you can move to\n( i , j + 1)\n( i , j - 1 )\n( i + 1 , j)\n( i - 1 ,  j)   \nInput Format\nThe first line contains 2 space separated integers N, M denoting dimensions of the grid.\nNext N lines contain M characters each without spaces consisting of P \xe2\x80\x99s,  O \xe2\x80\x99s, V and S . The input contains exactly one  V and exactly one S.\nConstraints\n4 \xe2\x89\xa4 N  *  M \xe2\x89\xa4 100000   \nOutput Format\nPrint a single line containing minimum steps that Sova needs to reach Reyna\xe2\x80\x99s location.\nSample Input\n3 3\nOVO\nOPO\nSOO   \nSample Output\n3   \nExplanation\nThere exist 2 possible paths from V to S. The path (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) is the shortest that requires 3 steps.   \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85flick_23\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HUNTER01\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 c-plus-plus, dynamic-programming, flick_23, nyre2020\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
