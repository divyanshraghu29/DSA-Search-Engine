b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.\nSome cooking competitions going on to be held in various cities and the Chef wants to participate in them. There are N cities numbered from 1 to N and they are connected by N\xe2\x88\x921 roads such that every city is connected to every other city. But traveling is a bit different here. Every city i is assigned a travel value, Ai. From a city numbered X, one can only travel to another city Y such that the simple path from X to Y has exactly AX roads.\nTo participate in a city's competition, the Chef just has to visit it. Help the Chef by finding the maximum number of competitions he can participate in if he can start from any city and visit any city multiple times.\nFormally, given a tree in which every node i is assigned a value Ai, you have to find the maximum number of distinct nodes that can be visited, if we can start from any node and visit any node multiple times. The only condition is that you can only move from node i to j if the number of edges between i and j is exactly Ai.\nNote: Usually, there is no bound on the stack memory, and is equal to the total memory limit of 1.5 GB. But due to a system configuration issue, the stack limit for C++ is temporarily set to 8MB. So, if you believe that your code requires larger stack limit, please include this in your code.\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N (1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105).\nNext N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain 2 integers each, ui and vi, denoting a road between cities ui and vi.\nNext line contains N space separated integers, A1\xe2\x8b\x85\xe2\x8b\x85\xe2\x8b\x85AN.\n\nOutput Format\nIn a single line, output the maximum number of cities that can be visited, starting from any one and visiting any city any number of times.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N and ui\xe2\x89\xa0vi\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\nIt is also guaranteed that the sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5\n1 3\n3 5\n1 4\n4 2\n1 2 3 3 1\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n8\n1 5\n1 6\n1 7\n1 8\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n6\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nIn example case 1,\n\nFrom city 1, Chef can move only to cities 3 or 4.\nFrom city 2, Chef can move only to city 1.\nFrom city 3, Chef can move only to city 2.\nFrom city 4, Chef can move only to city 5.\nFrom city 5, Chef can move only to city 3.\nChef can follow the path 1\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x86\x922\xe2\x86\x921\xe2\x86\x924\xe2\x86\x925, and visit every city.\n\nIn example case 2,\n\nChef can follow any path to visit all the vertices eventually. since every Ai = 1. \n\nIn example case 3,\n\nChef can follow the path 1\xe2\x86\x922\xe2\x86\x924\xe2\x86\x925.\nThere are other paths as well, but the maximum number would be 4 only.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85shikhar7s\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85theoneyouwant\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAXJMP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Directed Acyclic Graphs, Centroid Decomposition, Dynamic Programming, Strongly Connected Components, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Directed Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3395\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-08-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
