b'\nFlippy the bird has a tree with NN nodes. Each edge has a weight wiwi. We can choose one of the vertices as the root of the tree, say r. Then, the height of the node u would be the sum of the weights on the path from r to u.\nSuppose we take the node u as the root. What is the sum of the heights of all nodes? Answer this question for all possible nodes u.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer N, the number of nodes of the tree.\nThe next n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain three space-separated integers, u, v, w, denoting the endpoints of the edge and the weight of the edge respectively.\n\nOutput\nOutput n space-separated integers. The ith integer denotes the sum of heights of all vertices if node i is chosen as root.\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa4108\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (28 points): 2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000\nSubtask 2 (72 points): Original Constraints\nExample Input\n4\n1 2 3\n2 3 5\n2 4 6\n\nExample Output\n20 14 24 26\n\nExplanation\nThe heights of the nodes when the root is 1 are 0, 3, 8, 9 respectively. So, the sum is 0+3+8+9=20. Similarly, you can calculate this value for the case when other nodes are chosen as root as well.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85zscoder\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy, trees, zscoder\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-11-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
