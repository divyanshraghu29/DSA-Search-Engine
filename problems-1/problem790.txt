Yuezheng Ling and Dynamic Treetime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYuezheng Ling gives Luo Tianyi a tree which has nn nodes, rooted at 11. Luo Tianyi will tell you that the parent of the ii-th node is aiai (1?ai<i1?ai<i for 2?i?n2?i?n), and she will ask you to perform qq queries of 22 types: She'll give you three integers ll, rr and xx (2?l?r?n2?l?r?n, 1?x?1051?x?105). You need to replace aiai with max(ai?x,1)max(ai?x,1) for all ii with l?i?rl?i?r. She'll give you two integers uu, vv (1?u,v?n1?u,v?n). You need to find the LCA of nodes uu and vv (their lowest common ancestor).InputThe first line contains two integers nn and qq (2?n,q?1052?n,q?105) ? the number of nodes and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains n?1n?1 integers a2,a3,?,ana2,a3,?,an (1?ai<i1?ai<i), where aiai is the parent of the node ii.Next qq lines contain queries. For each query, the first integer of each line is tt (t=1t=1 or 22) ? the type of the query.  If t=1t=1, this represents the query of the first type. Then, three integers will follow: ll, rr, xx (2?l?r?n2?l?r?n, 1?x?1051?x?105), meaning that you have to replace aiai with max(ai?x,1)max(ai?x,1) for all ii with l?i?rl?i?r. If t=2t=2, this represents the query of the second type. Then, two integers will follow: uu and vv (1?u,v?n1?u,v?n), and you have to find the LCA of uu and vv.  It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the second type.OutputFor each query of the second type output answer on a new line.ExampleInputCopy6 4, 1 2 3 3 4, 2 3 4, 1 2 3 1, 2 5 6, 2 2 3, OutputCopy3, 3, 1, NoteThe tree in example is shown below.  After the query of the first type, the tree changes and is looking as shown below.  "
