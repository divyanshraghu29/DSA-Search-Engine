For each query you are given two integers l and r (l<r). For each query you should find the cost of the subarray al,al+1,?,ar.InputEach test case consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1?t?104)?? the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2?n?105)?? the length array a.The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,?,an (0?ai<230)?? the elements of a.The third line of each test case contains an integer q (1?q?105)?? the number of queries.Each of the next q lines contains two integers lj, rj (1?lj<rj?n)?? the description of the j-th query.It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 105.OutputFor each test case print q numbers, where the j-th number is the cost of array alj,alj+1,?,arj.ExampleInputCopy2, 5, 6 1 3 2 1, 4, 1 2, 2 3, 2 4, 2 5, 4, 0 2 1 1073741823, 4, 1 2, 2 3, 1 3, 3 4, OutputCopy7, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1073741823, NoteIn the first test case the array a is1102,0012,0112,0102,0012.That's why the answers for the queries are:  [1;2]: a1|a2=1102|0012=1112=7;  [2;3]: a2|a3=0012|0112=0112=3;  [2;4]: a2|a3=a3|a4=a2|a4=0112=3;  [2;5]: a2|a5=0012=1. In the second test case the array a is002,102,012,11?12?30 (a4=230?1).That's why the answers for the queries are:  [1;2]: a1|a2=102=2;  [2;3]: a2|a3=112=3;  [1;3]: a1|a3=012=1;  [3;4]: a3|a4=012|11?12?30=230?1=1073741823.
